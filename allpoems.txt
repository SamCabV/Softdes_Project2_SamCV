                        Pretty women wonder where my secret lies.I'm not cute or built to suit a fashion model's sizeBut when I start to tell them,They think I'm telling lies.I say,It's in the reach of my armsThe span of my hips,The stride of my step,The curl of my lips.I'm a womanPhenomenally.Phenomenal woman,That's me.I walk into a roomJust as cool as you please,And to a man,The fellows stand orFall down on their knees.Then they swarm around me,A hive of honey bees.I say,It's the fire in my eyes,And the flash of my teeth,The swing in my waist,And the joy in my feet.I'm a womanPhenomenally.Phenomenal woman,That's me.Men themselves have wonderedWhat they see in me.They try so muchBut they can't touchMy inner mystery.When I try to show themThey say they still can't see.I say,It's in the arch of my back,The sun of my smile,The ride of my breasts,The grace of my style.I'm a womanPhenomenally.Phenomenal woman,That's me.Now you understandJust why my head's not bowed.I don't shout or jump aboutOr have to talk real loud.When you see me passingIt ought to make you proud.I say,It's in the click of my heels,The bend of my hair,the palm of my hand,The need of my care,'Cause I'm a womanPhenomenally.Phenomenal woman,That's me. 
                        

                        You may write me down in historyWith your bitter, twisted lies,You may tread me in the very dirtBut still, like dust, I'll rise.Does my sassiness upset you? Why are you beset with gloom? 'Cause I walk like I've got oil wellsPumping in my living room.Just like moons and like suns,With the certainty of tides,Just like hopes springing high,Still I'll rise.Did you want to see me broken? Bowed head and lowered eyes? Shoulders falling down like teardrops.Weakened by my soulful cries.Does my haughtiness offend you? Don't you take it awful hard'Cause I laugh like I've got gold minesDiggin' in my own back yard.You may shoot me with your words,You may cut me with your eyes,You may kill me with your hatefulness,But still, like air, I'll rise.Does my sexiness upset you? Does it come as a surpriseThat I dance like I've got diamondsAt the meeting of my thighs? Out of the huts of history's shameI riseUp from a past that's rooted in painI riseI'm a black ocean, leaping and wide,Welling and swelling I bear in the tide.Leaving behind nights of terror and fearI riseInto a daybreak that's wondrously clearI riseBringing the gifts that my ancestors gave,I am the dream and the hope of the slave.I riseI riseI rise. 
                        

                        Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,And sorry I could not travel bothAnd be one traveler, long I stoodAnd looked down one as far as I couldTo where it bent in the undergrowth; Then took the other, as just as fair,And having perhaps the better claimBecause it was grassy and wanted wear,Though as for that the passing thereHad worn them really about the same,And both that morning equally layIn leaves no step had trodden black.Oh, I kept the first for another day! Yet knowing how way leads on to wayI doubted if I should ever come back.I shall be telling this with a sighSomewhere ages and ages hence:Two roads diverged in a wood, and I,I took the one less traveled by,And that has made all the difference. 
                        

                        I want you to knowone thing. You know how this is: if I look at the crystal moon, at the red branch of the slow autumn at my window, if I touch near the fire the impalpable ash or the wrinkled body of the log, everything carries me to you, as if everything that exists, aromas, light, metals, were little boats that sail toward those isles of yours that wait for me. Well, now, if little by little you stop loving me I shall stop loving you little by little. If suddenly you forget me do not look for me, for I shall already have forgotten you. If you think it long and mad, the wind of banners that passes through my life, and you decide to leave me at the shore of the heart where I have roots, remember that on that day, at that hour, I shall lift my arms and my roots will set off to seek another land. But if each day, each hour, you feel that you are destined for me with implacable sweetness, if each day a flower climbs up to your lips to seek me, ah my love, ah my own, in me all that fire is repeated, in me nothing is extinguished or forgotten, my love feeds on your love, beloved, and as long as you live it will be in your arms without leaving mine. 
                        

                        Hold fast to dreamsFor if dreams dieLife is a broken-winged birdThat cannot fly.Hold fast to dreamsFor when dreams goLife is a barren fieldFrozen with snow. 
                        

                        It was many and many a year ago,          In a kingdom by the sea,    That a maiden there lived whom you may know          By the name of ANNABEL LEE;     And this maiden she lived with no other thought          Than to love and be loved by me.    I was a child and she was a child,          In this kingdom by the sea;     But we loved with a love that was more than love-          I and my Annabel Lee;     With a love that the winged seraphs of heaven          Coveted her and me.    And this was the reason that, long ago,          In this kingdom by the sea,    A wind blew out of a cloud, chilling          My beautiful Annabel Lee;     So that her highborn kinsman came          And bore her away from me,    To shut her up in a sepulchre          In this kingdom by the sea.    The angels, not half so happy in heaven,          Went envying her and me-    Yes! - that was the reason (as all men know,          In this kingdom by the sea)     That the wind came out of the cloud by night,          Chilling and killing my Annabel Lee.    But our love it was stronger by far than the love          Of those who were older than we-          Of many far wiser than we-    And neither the angels in heaven above,          Nor the demons down under the sea,    Can ever dissever my soul from the soul          Of the beautiful Annabel Lee.    For the moon never beams without bringing me dreams          Of the beautiful Annabel Lee;     And the stars never rise but I feel the bright eyes          Of the beautiful Annabel Lee;     And so, all the night-tide, I lie down by the side    Of my darling- my darling- my life and my bride,          In the sepulchre there by the sea,          In her tomb by the sounding sea. 
                        

                        The free bird leapson the back of the windand floats downstreamtill the current endsand dips his wingsin the orange sun raysand dares to claim the sky.But a bird that stalksdown his narrow cagecan seldom see throughhis bars of ragehis wings are clipped andhis feet are tiedso he opens his throat to sing.The caged bird singswith fearful trillof the things unknownbut longed for stilland his tune is heardon the distant hill for the caged birdsings of freedomThe free bird thinks of another breezeand the trade winds soft through the sighing treesand the fat worms waiting on a dawn-bright lawnand he names the sky his own.But a caged bird stands on the grave of dreamshis shadow shouts on a nightmare screamhis wings are clipped and his feet are tiedso he opens his throat to singThe caged bird singswith a fearful trillof things unknownbut longed for stilland his tune is heardon the distant hillfor the caged birdsings of freedom. 
                        

                        Whose woods these are I think I know.His house is in the village, though; He will not see me stopping hereTo watch his woods fill up with snow.My little horse must think it queerTo stop without a farmhouse nearBetween the woods and frozen lakeThe darkest evening of the year.He gives his harness bells a shakeTo ask if there is some mistake.The only other sound's the sweepOf easy wind and downy flake.The woods are lovely, dark and deep,But I have promises to keep,And miles to go before I sleep,And miles to go before I sleep. 
                        

                        The most important thing we've learned,So far as children are concerned,Is never, NEVER, NEVER letThem near your television set --Or better still, just don't installThe idiotic thing at all.In almost every house we've been,We've watched them gaping at the screen.They loll and slop and lounge about,And stare until their eyes pop out.(Last week in someone's place we sawA dozen eyeballs on the floor.)They sit and stare and stare and sitUntil they're hypnotised by it,Until they're absolutely drunkWith all that shocking ghastly junk.Oh yes, we know it keeps them still,They don't climb out the window sill,They never fight or kick or punch,They leave you free to cook the lunchAnd wash the dishes in the sink --But did you ever stop to think,To wonder just exactly whatThis does to your beloved tot?IT ROTS THE SENSE IN THE HEAD!IT KILLS IMAGINATION DEAD!IT CLOGS AND CLUTTERS UP THE MIND!IT MAKES A CHILD SO DULL AND BLINDHE CAN NO LONGER UNDERSTANDA FANTASY, A FAIRYLAND!HIS BRAIN BECOMES AS SOFT AS CHEESE!HIS POWERS OF THINKING RUST AND FREEZE!HE CANNOT THINK -- HE ONLY SEES!'All right!' you'll cry. 'All right!' you'll say,'But if we take the set away,What shall we do to entertainOur darling children? Please explain!'We'll answer this by asking you,'What used the darling ones to do?'How used they keep themselves contentedBefore this monster was invented?'Have you forgotten? Don't you know?We'll say it very loud and slow:THEY ... USED ... TO ... READ! They'd READ and READ,AND READ and READ, and then proceedTo READ some more. Great Scott! Gadzooks!One half their lives was reading books!The nursery shelves held books galore!Books cluttered up the nursery floor!And in the bedroom, by the bed,More books were waiting to be read!Such wondrous, fine, fantastic talesOf dragons, gypsies, queens, and whalesAnd treasure isles, and distant shoresWhere smugglers rowed with muffled oars,And pirates wearing purple pants,And sailing ships and elephants,And cannibals crouching 'round the pot,Stirring away at something hot.(It smells so good, what can it be?Good gracious, it's Penelope.)The younger ones had Beatrix PotterWith Mr. Tod, the dirty rotter,And Squirrel Nutkin, Pigling Bland,And Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle and-Just How The Camel Got His Hump,And How the Monkey Lost His Rump,And Mr. Toad, and bless my soul,There's Mr. Rat and Mr. Mole-Oh, books, what books they used to know,Those children living long ago!So please, oh please, we beg, we pray,Go throw your TV set away,And in its place you can installA lovely bookshelf on the wall.Then fill the shelves with lots of books,Ignoring all the dirty looks,The screams and yells, the bites and kicks,And children hitting you with sticks-Fear not, because we promise youThat, in about a week or twoOf having nothing else to do,They'll now begin to feel the needOf having something to read.And once they start -- oh boy, oh boy!You watch the slowly growing joyThat fills their hearts. They'll grow so keenThey'll wonder what they'd ever seenIn that ridiculous machine,That nauseating, foul, unclean,Repulsive television screen!And later, each and every kidWill love you more for what you did. 
                        

                        If you can keep your head when all about you  Are losing theirs and blaming it on you; If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,  But make allowance for their doubting too:If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,  Or, being lied about, don't deal in lies,Or being hated don't give way to hating,  And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise;  If you can dream- -and not make dreams your master;   If you can think- -and not make thoughts your aim,If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster  And treat those two impostors just the same:.If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken  Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,  And stoop and build'em up with worn-out tools;  If you can make one heap of all your winnings  And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,And lose, and start again at your beginnings,  And never breathe a word about your loss:If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew  To serve your turn long after they are gone,And so hold on when there is nothing in you  Except the Will which says to them: 'Hold on! ' If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,  Or walk with Kings- -nor lose the common touch,If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,  If all men count with you, but none too much:If you can fill the unforgiving minute  With sixty seconds' worth of distance run,Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it,  And- -which is more- -you'll be a Man, my son! 
                        

                        Do not stand at my grave and weep  I am not there. I do not sleep.  I am a thousand winds that blow.  I am the diamond glints on snow.  I am the sunlight on ripened grain.  I am the gentle autumn rain.  When you awaken in the morning's hush  I am the swift uplifting rush  Of quiet birds in circled flight.  I am the soft stars that shine at night.  Do not stand at my grave and cry;  I am not there. I did not die. 
                        

                        I do not love you except because I love you; I go from loving to not loving you,From waiting to not waiting for youMy heart moves from cold to fire.I love you only because it's you the one I love; I hate you deeply, and hating youBend to you, and the measure of my changing love for youIs that I do not see you but love you blindly.Maybe January light will consumeMy heart with its cruelRay, stealing my key to true calm.In this part of the story I am the one whoDies, the only one, and I will die of love because I love you,Because I love you, Love, in fire and blood. 
                        

                        Some say the world will end in fire,Some say in ice.From what I've tasted of desireI hold with those who favor fire.But if it had to perish twice,I think I know enough of hateTo say that for destruction iceIs also greatAnd would suffice. 
                        

                        It was a long time ago.I have almost forgotten my dream.But it was there then,In front of me,Bright like a sun—My dream.And then the wall rose,Rose slowly,Slowly,Between me and my dream.Rose until it touched the sky—The wall.Shadow.I am black.I lie down in the shadow.No longer the light of my dream before me,Above me.Only the thick wall.Only the shadow.My hands! My dark hands! Break through the wall! Find my dream! Help me to shatter this darkness,To smash this night,To break this shadowInto a thousand lights of sun,Into a thousand whirling dreamsOf sun! 
                        

                        Take this kiss upon the brow!           And, in parting from you now,          Thus much let me avow-          You are not wrong, who deem          That my days have been a dream;           Yet if hope has flown away          In a night, or in a day,          In a vision, or in none,          Is it therefore the less gone?           All that we see or seem          Is but a dream within a dream.          I stand amid the roar          Of a surf-tormented shore,          And I hold within my hand          Grains of the golden sand-          How few! yet how they creep          Through my fingers to the deep,          While I weep- while I weep!           O God! can I not grasp          Them with a tighter clasp?           O God! can I not save          One from the pitiless wave?           Is all that we see or seem          But a dream within a dream? 
                        

                        Out of the night that covers me,Black as the Pit from pole to pole,I thank whatever gods may beFor my unconquerable soul.In the fell clutch of circumstanceI have not winced nor cried aloud.Under the bludgeonings of chanceMy head is bloody, but unbowed.Beyond this place of wrath and tearsLooms but the Horror of the shade,And yet the menace of the yearsFinds, and shall find, me unafraid.It matters not how strait the gate,How charged with punishments the scroll.I am the master of my fate:I am the captain of my soul. 
                        

                        When I am an old woman I shall wear purpleWith a red hat which doesn't go, and doesn't suit me.And I shall spend my pension on brandy and summer glovesAnd satin sandals, and say we've no money for butter.I shall sit down on the pavement when I'm tiredAnd gobble up samples in shops and press alarm bellsAnd run my stick along the public railingsAnd make up for the sobriety of my youth.I shall go out in my slippers in the rainAnd pick flowers in other people's gardensAnd learn to spit.You can wear terrible shirts and grow more fatAnd eat three pounds of sausages at a goOr only bread and pickle for a weekAnd hoard pens and pencils and beermats and things in boxes.But now we must have clothes that keep us dryAnd pay our rent and not swear in the streetAnd set a good example for the children.We must have friends to dinner and read the papers.But maybe I ought to practice a little now?So people who know me are not too shocked and surprisedWhen suddenly I am old, and start to wear purple. 
                        

                        Do not go gentle into that good night,Old age should burn and rave at close of day; Rage, rage against the dying of the light.Though wise men at their end know dark is right,Because their words had forked no lightning theyDo not go gentle into that good night.Good men, the last wave by, crying how brightTheir frail deeds might have danced in a green bay,Rage, rage against the dying of the light.Wild men who caught and sang the sun in flight,And learn, too late, they grieved it on its way,Do not go gentle into that good night.Grave men, near death, who see with blinding sightBlind eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay,Rage, rage against the dying of the light.And you, my father, there on that sad height,Curse, bless, me now with your fierce tears, I pray.Do not go gentle into that good night.Rage, rage against the dying of the light. 
                        

                        Don't go far off, not even for a day, because -- because -- I don't know how to say it: a day is long and I will be waiting for you, as in an empty station when the trains are parked off somewhere else, asleep. Don't leave me, even for an hour, because then the little drops of anguish will all run together, the smoke that roams looking for a home will drift into me, choking my lost heart. Oh, may your silhouette never dissolve on the beach; may your eyelids never flutter into the empty distance. Don't leave me for a second, my dearest, because in that moment you'll have gone so far I'll wander mazily over all the earth, asking, Will you come back? Will you leave me here, dying? 
                        

                        From childhood's hour I have not been        As others were; I have not seen        As others saw; I could not bring        My passions from a common spring.        From the same source I have not taken        My sorrow; I could not awaken        My heart to joy at the same tone;        And all I loved, I loved alone.        Then- in my childhood, in the dawn        Of a most stormy life- was drawn        From every depth of good and ill        The mystery which binds me still:        From the torrent, or the fountain,        From the red cliff of the mountain,        From the sun that round me rolled        In its autumn tint of gold,        From the lightning in the sky        As it passed me flying by,        From the thunder and the storm,        And the cloud that took the form        (When the rest of Heaven was blue)        Of a demon in my view. 
                        

                        I was angry with my friend:I told my wrath, my wrath did end.I was angry with my foe:I told it not, my wrath did grow.And I watered it in fears,Night and morning with my tears; And I sunned it with smiles,And with soft deceitful wiles.And it grew both day and night,Till it bore an apple bright.And my foe beheld it shine.And he knew that it was mine,And into my garden stoleWhen the night had veiled the pole; In the morning glad I seeMy foe outstretched beneath the tree. 
                        

                        'Hope' is the thing with feathers—That perches in the soul—And sings the tune without the words—And never stops—at all—And sweetest—in the Gale—is heard—And sore must be the storm—That could abash the little BirdThat kept so many warm—I've heard it in the chillest land—And on the strangest Sea—Yet, never, in Extremity,It asked a crumb—of Me. 
                        

                        I wandered lonely as a cloudThat floats on high o'er vales and hills,When all at once I saw a crowd,A host, of golden daffodils; Beside the lake, beneath the trees,Fluttering and dancing in the breeze.Continuous as the stars that shineAnd twinkle on the milky way,They stretched in never-ending lineAlong the margin of a bay:Ten thousand saw I at a glance,Tossing their heads in sprightly dance.The waves beside them danced; but theyOut-did the sparkling waves in glee:A poet could not but be gay,In such a jocund company:I gazed- and gazed- but little thoughtWhat wealth the show to me had brought:For oft, when on my couch I lieIn vacant or in pensive mood,They flash upon that inward eyeWhich is the bliss of solitude; And then my heart with pleasure fills,And dances with the daffodils.

                        Well, son, I'll tell you:Life for me ain't been no crystal stair.It's had tacks in it,And splinters,And boards torn up,And places with no carpet on the floor—Bare.But all the time I'se been a-climbin' on,And reachin' landin's,And turnin' corners,And sometimes goin' in the darkWhere there ain't been no light.So, boy, don't you turn back.Don't you set down on the steps.'Cause you finds it's kinder hard.Don't you fall now—For I'se still goin', honey,I'se still climbin',And life for me ain't been no crystal stair. 
                        

                        All the world's a stage,And all the men and women merely players;They have their exits and their entrances,And one man in his time plays many parts,His acts being seven ages. At first, the infant,Mewling and puking in the nurse's arms.Then the whining schoolboy, with his satchelAnd shining morning face, creeping like snailUnwillingly to school. And then the lover,Sighing like furnace, with a woeful balladMade to his mistress' eyebrow. Then a soldier,Full of strange oaths and bearded like the pard,Jealous in honor, sudden and quick in quarrel,Seeking the bubble reputationEven in the cannon's mouth. And then the justice,In fair round belly with good capon lined,With eyes severe and beard of formal cut,Full of wise saws and modern instances;And so he plays his part. The sixth age shiftsInto the lean and slippered pantaloon,With spectacles on nose and pouch on side;His youthful hose, well saved, a world too wideFor his shrunk shank, and his big manly voice,Turning again toward childish treble, pipesAnd whistles in his sound. Last scene of all,That ends this strange eventful history,Is second childishness and mere oblivion,Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans everything. 
                        

                                                                  PART ONE                                                 I    THE wind was a torrent of darkness among the gusty trees,     The moon was a ghostly galleon tossed upon cloudy seas,     The road was a ribbon of moonlight over the purple moor,     And the highwayman came riding—                       Riding—riding—     The highwayman came riding, up to the old inn-door.                                                 II    He'd a French cocked-hat on his forehead, a bunch of lace at his chin,     A coat of the claret velvet, and breeches of brown doe-skin;     They fitted with never a wrinkle: his boots were up to the thigh!     And he rode with a jewelled twinkle,                       His pistol butts a-twinkle,     His rapier hilt a-twinkle, under the jewelled sky.                                                 III    Over the cobbles he clattered and clashed in the dark inn-yard,     And he tapped with his whip on the shutters, but all was locked and barred;     He whistled a tune to the window, and who should be waiting there     But the landlord's black-eyed daughter,                       Bess, the landlord's daughter,     Plaiting a dark red love-knot into her long black hair.                                                 IV    And dark in the dark old inn-yard a stable-wicket creaked     Where Tim the ostler listened; his face was white and peaked;     His eyes were hollows of madness, his hair like mouldy hay,     But he loved the landlord's daughter,                       The landlord's red-lipped daughter,     Dumb as a dog he listened, and he heard the robber say—                                                 V    'One kiss, my bonny sweetheart, I'm after a prize to-night,     But I shall be back with the yellow gold before the morning light;     Yet, if they press me sharply, and harry me through the day,     Then look for me by moonlight,                       Watch for me by moonlight,     I'll come to thee by moonlight, though hell should bar the way.'                                                 VI    He rose upright in the stirrups; he scarce could reach her hand,     But she loosened her hair i' the casement! His face burnt like a brand     As the black cascade of perfume came tumbling over his breast;     And he kissed its waves in the moonlight,                       (Oh, sweet, black waves in the moonlight!)     Then he tugged at his rein in the moonliglt, and galloped away to the West.                                         PART TWO                                                 I    He did not come in the dawning; he did not come at noon;     And out o' the tawny sunset, before the rise o' the moon,     When the road was a gypsy's ribbon, looping the purple moor,     A red-coat troop came marching—                       Marching—marching—     King George's men came matching, up to the old inn-door.                                                 II    They said no word to the landlord, they drank his ale instead,     But they gagged his daughter and bound her to the foot of her narrow bed;     Two of them knelt at her casement, with muskets at their side!     There was death at every window;                       And hell at one dark window;     For Bess could see, through her casement, the road that he would ride.                                                 III    They had tied her up to attention, with many a sniggering jest;     They had bound a musket beside her, with the barrel beneath her breast!     'Now, keep good watch!' and they kissed her.                       She heard the dead man say—     Look for me by moonlight;                       Watch for me by moonlight;     I'll come to thee by moonlight, though hell should bar the way!                                                 IV    She twisted her hands behind her; but all the knots held good!     She writhed her hands till her fingers were wet with sweat or blood!     They stretched and strained in the darkness, and the hours crawled by like years,     Till, now, on the stroke of midnight,                       Cold, on the stroke of midnight,     The tip of one finger touched it! The trigger at least was hers!                                                 V    The tip of one finger touched it; she strove no more for the rest!     Up, she stood up to attention, with the barrel beneath her breast,     She would not risk their hearing; she would not strive again;     For the road lay bare in the moonlight;                       Blank and bare in the moonlight;     And the blood of her veins in the moonlight throbbed to her love's refrain .                                                 VI        Tlot-tlot; tlot-tlot! Had they heard it? The horse-hoofs ringing clear;     Tlot-tlot, tlot-tlot, in the distance? Were they deaf that they did not hear?     Down the ribbon of moonlight, over the brow of the hill,     The highwayman came riding,                       Riding, riding!     The red-coats looked to their priming! She stood up, straight and still!                                                 VII    Tlot-tlot, in the frosty silence! Tlot-tlot, in the echoing night!     Nearer he came and nearer! Her face was like a light!     Her eyes grew wide for a moment; she drew one last deep breath,     Then her finger moved in the moonlight,                       Her musket shattered the moonlight,     Shattered her breast in the moonlight and warned him—with her death.                                                 VIII    He turned; he spurred to the West; he did not know who stood     Bowed, with her head o'er the musket, drenched with her own red blood!     Not till the dawn he heard it, his face grew grey to hear     How Bess, the landlord's daughter,                       The landlord's black-eyed daughter,     Had watched for her love in the moonlight, and died in the darkness there.                                                 IX    Back, he spurred like a madman, shrieking a curse to the sky,     With the white road smoking behind him and his rapier brandished high!     Blood-red were his spurs i' the golden noon; wine-red was his velvet coat,     When they shot him down on the highway,                       Down like a dog on the highway,     And he lay in his blood on the highway, with the bunch of lace at his throat.                                                 X    And still of a winter's night, they say, when the wind is in the trees,     When the moon is a ghostly galleon tossed upon cloudy seas,     When the road is a ribbon of moonlight over the purple moor,     A highwayman comes riding—                       Riding—riding—     A highwayman comes riding, up to the old inn-door.                                                 XI    Over the cobbles he clatters and clangs in the dark inn-yard;     He taps with his whip on the shutters, but all is locked and barred;     He whistles a tune to the window, and who should be waiting there     But the landlord's black-eyed daughter,                       Bess, the landlord's daughter,     Plaiting a dark red love-knot into her long black hair.

                        The time will come when, with elation you will greet yourself arriving at your own door, in your own mirror and each will smile at the other's welcome, and say, sit here. Eat. You will love again the stranger who was your self.Give wine. Give bread. Give back your heart to itself, to the stranger who has loved you all your life, whom you ignored for another, who knows you by heart. Take down the love letters from the bookshelf, the photographs, the desperate notes, peel your own image from the mirror. Sit. Feast on your life. 
                        

                        No man is an island,Entire of itself,Every man is a piece of the continent,A part of the main.If a clod be washed away by the sea,Europe is the less.As well as if a promontory were.As well as if a manor of thy friend'sOr of thine own were:Any man's death diminishes me,Because I am involved in mankind,And therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls; It tolls for thee. 
                        

   O CAPTAIN! my Captain! our fearful trip is done;   The ship has weather'd every rack, the prize we sought is won;   The port is near, the bells I hear, the people all exulting,   While follow eyes the steady keel, the vessel grim and daring:       But O heart! heart! heart!         O the bleeding drops of red,           Where on the deck my Captain lies,             Fallen cold and dead.   O Captain! my Captain! rise up and hear the bells;   Rise up--for you the flag is flung--for you the bugle trills;      10   For you bouquets and ribbon'd wreaths--for you the shores a-crowding;   For you they call, the swaying mass, their eager faces turning;       Here Captain! dear father!         This arm beneath your head;           It is some dream that on the deck,             You've fallen cold and dead.   My Captain does not answer, his lips are pale and still;   My father does not feel my arm, he has no pulse nor will;   The ship is anchor'd safe and sound, its voyage closed and done;   From fearful trip, the victor ship, comes in with object won;      20       Exult, O shores, and ring, O bells!         But I, with mournful tread,           Walk the deck my Captain lies,             Fallen cold and dead.

                        In England once there lived a bigAnd wonderfully clever pig.To everybody it was plainThat Piggy had a massive brain.He worked out sums inside his head,There was no book he hadn't read.He knew what made an airplane fly,He knew how engines worked and why.He knew all this, but in the endOne question drove him round the bend:He simply couldn't puzzle outWhat LIFE was really all about.What was the reason for his birth? Why was he placed upon this earth? His giant brain went round and round.Alas, no answer could be found.Till suddenly one wondrous night.All in a flash he saw the light.He jumped up like a ballet dancerAnd yelled, 'By gum, I've got the answer! ''They want my bacon slice by slice'To sell at a tremendous price! 'They want my tender juicy chops'To put in all the butcher's shops! 'They want my pork to make a roast'And that's the part'll cost the most! 'They want my sausages in strings! 'They even want my chitterlings! 'The butcher's shop! The carving knife! 'That is the reason for my life! 'Such thoughts as these are not designedTo give a pig great peace of mind.Next morning, in comes Farmer Bland,A pail of pigswill in his hand,And piggy with a mighty roar,Bashes the farmer to the floor…Now comes the rather grisly bitSo let's not make too much of it,Except that you must understandThat Piggy did eat Farmer Bland,He ate him up from head to toe,Chewing the pieces nice and slow.It took an hour to reach the feet,Because there was so much to eat,And when he finished, Pig, of course,Felt absolutely no remorse.Slowly he scratched his brainy headAnd with a little smile he said,'I had a fairly powerful hunch'That he might have me for his lunch.'And so, because I feared the worst,'I thought I'd better eat him first.'

                        Tell me not, in mournful numbers,Life is but an empty dream! For the soul is dead that slumbers,And things are not what they seem.Life is real! Life is earnest! And the grave is not its goal; Dust thou art, to dust returnest,Was not spoken of the soul.Not enjoyment, and not sorrow,Is our destined end or way; But to act, that each to-morrowFind us farther than to-day.Art is long, and Time is fleeting,And our hearts, though stout and brave,Still, like muffled drums, are beatingFuneral marches to the grave.In the world’s broad field of battle,In the bivouac of Life,Be not like dumb, driven cattle! Be a hero in the strife! Trust no Future, howe’er pleasant! Let the dead Past bury its dead! Act,— act in the living Present! Heart within, and God o’erhead! Lives of great men all remind usWe can make our lives sublime,And, departing, leave behind usFootprints on the sands of time; Footprints, that perhaps another,Sailing o’er life’s solemn main,A forlorn and shipwrecked brother,Seeing, shall take heart again.Let us, then, be up and doing,With a heart for any fate; Still achieving, still pursuing,Learn to labor and to wait.

                        Over hill, over dale,Thorough bush, thorough brier,Over park, over pale,Thorough flood, thorough fire!I do wander everywhere,Swifter than the moon's sphere;And I serve the Fairy Queen,To dew her orbs upon the green;The cowslips tall her pensioners be;In their gold coats spots you see;Those be rubies, fairy favours;In those freckles live their savours;I must go seek some dewdrops here,And hang a pearl in every cowslip's ear. 
                        

                        How do I love thee? Let me count the ways. I love thee to the depth and breadth and height My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight For the ends of Being and ideal Grace. I love thee to the level of every day's Most quiet need, by sun and candlelight. I love thee freely, as men strive for Right; I love thee purely, as they turn from Praise. I love with a passion put to use In my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith. I love thee with a love I seemed to lose With my lost saints, -- I love thee with the breath, Smiles, tears, of all my life! -- and, if God choose, I shall but love thee better after death. 
                        

                        Remember me when I am gone away,         Gone far away into the silent land;         When you can no more hold me by the hand,     Nor I half turn to go yet turning stay.     Remember me when no more day by day         You tell me of our future that you plann'd:         Only remember me; you understand     It will be late to counsel then or pray.     Yet if you should forget me for a while       And afterwards remember, do not grieve:       For if the darkness and corruption leave       A vestige of the thoughts that once I had,   Better by far you should forget and smile       Than that you should remember and be sad.

                        A thing of beauty is a joy for ever: Its lovliness increases; it will never Pass into nothingness; but still will keep A bower quiet for us, and a sleep Full of sweet dreams, and health, and quiet breathing. Therefore, on every morrow, are we wreathing A flowery band to bind us to the earth, Spite of despondence, of the inhuman dearth Of noble natures, of the gloomy days, Of all the unhealthy and o'er-darkn'd ways Made for our searching: yes, in spite of all, Some shape of beauty moves away the pall From our dark spirits. Such the sun, the moon, Trees old and young, sprouting a shady boon For simple sheep; and such are daffodils With the green world they live in; and clear rills That for themselves a cooling covert make 'Gainst the hot season; the mid-forest brake, Rich with a sprinkling of fair musk-rose blooms: And such too is the grandeur of the dooms We have imagined for the mighty dead; An endless fountain of immortal drink, Pouring unto us from the heaven's brink.

                        I met a traveller from an antique landWho said: `Two vast and trunkless legs of stoneStand in the desert. Near them, on the sand,Half sunk, a shattered visage lies, whose frown,And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,Tell that its sculptor  well those passions readWhich yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,The hand that mocked them and the heart that fed.And on the pedestal these words appear --"My name is Ozymandias, king of kings:Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!"Nothing beside remains. Round the decayOf that colossal wreck, boundless and bareThe lone and level sands stretch far away.' 
                        

                        And death shall have no dominion.Dead man naked they shall be oneWith the man in the wind and the west moon; When their bones are picked clean and the clean bones gone,They shall have stars at elbow and foot; Though they go mad they shall be sane,Though they sink through the sea they shall rise again; Though lovers be lost love shall not; And death shall have no dominion.And death shall have no dominion.Under the windings of the seaThey lying long shall not die windily; Twisting on racks when sinews give way,Strapped to a wheel, yet they shall not break; Faith in their hands shall snap in two,And the unicorn evils run them through; Split all ends up they shan't crack; And death shall have no dominion.And death shall have no dominion.No more may gulls cry at their earsOr waves break loud on the seashores; Where blew a flower may a flower no moreLift its head to the blows of the rain; Though they be mad and dead as nails,Heads of the characters hammer through daisies; Break in the sun till the sun breaks down,And death shall have no dominion.

                        Bent double, like old beggars under sacks,Knock-kneed, coughing like hags, we cursed through sludge,Till on the haunting flares we turned out backs,And towards our distant rest began to trudge.Men marched asleep. Many had lost their boots,But limped on, blood-shod. All went lame, all blind; Drunk with fatigue; deaf even to the hootsOf gas-shells dropping softly behind.Gas! GAS! Quick, boys! - An ecstasy of fumblingFitting the clumsy helmets just in time,But someone still was yelling out and stumblingAnd flound'ring like a man in fire or lime.- Dim through the misty panes and thick green light,As under a green sea, I saw him drowning.In all my dreams before my helpless sightHe plunges at me, guttering, choking, drowning.If in some smothering dreams, you too could paceBehind the wagon that we flung him in,And watch the white eyes writhing in his face,His hanging face, like a devil's sick of sin,If you could hear, at every jolt, the bloodCome gargling from the froth-corrupted lungsObscene as cancer, bitter as the cudOf vile, incurable sores on innocent tongues,- My friend, you would not tell with such high zestTo children ardent for some desperate glory,The old Lie: Dulce et decorum estPro patria mori. 
                        

                        I love chocolate cake.And when I was a boyI loved it even more.Sometimes we used to have it for teaand Mum used to say,'If there's any left overyou can have it to take to schooltomorrow to have at playtime.'And the next day I would take it to schoolwrapped up in tin foilopen it up at playtimeand sit in the corner of the playgroundeating it,you know how the icing on topis all shiny and it cracks as youbite into it,and there's that other kind of icing inthe middleand it sticks to your hands and youcan lick your fingersand lick your lipsoh it's lovely.yeah.Anyway,once we had this chocolate cake for teaand later I went to bedbut while I was in bedI found myself waking uplicking my lipsand smiling.I woke up proper.'The chocolate cake.'It was the first thing1 thought of.I could almost see itso I thought,what if I go downstairsand have a little nibble, yeah?It was all darkeveryone was in bedso it must have been really latebut I got out of bed,crept out of the doorthere's always a creaky floorboard, isn't there?Past Mum and Dad's room,careful not to tread on bits of broken toysor bits of Legoyou know what it's like treading on Legowith your bare feet,yowwwwshhhhhhhdownstairs into the kitchenopen the cupboardand there it isall shining.So I take it out of the cupboardput it on the tableand I see thatthere's a few crumbs lying about on the plate,so I lick my finger and run my finger all over the crumbsscooping them upand put them into my mouth.oooooooommmmmmmmmnice.< br>ThenI look againand on one side where it's been cut,it's all crumbly.So I take a knifeI think I'll just tidy that up a bit,cut off the crumbly bitsscoop them all upand into the mouthoooooommm mmmmnice.Look at the cake again.That looks a bit funny now,one side doesn't match the otherI'll just even it up a bit, eh?Take the knifeand slice.This time the knife makes a little cracky noiseas it goes through that hard icing on top.A whole slice this time,into the mouth.Oh the icing on topand the icing in the middleohhhhhh oooo mmmmmm.But nowI can't stop myselfKnife -1 just take any old slice at itand I've got this great big chunkand I'm cramming it inwhat a greedy pigbut it's so nice,and there's anotherand another and I'm squealing and I'm smacking my lipsand I'm stuffing myself with itandbefore I knowI've eaten the lot.The whole lot.I look at the plate.It's all gone.Oh nothey're bound to notice, aren't they,a whole chocolate cake doesn't just disappeardoes it?What shall 1 do?I know.

                        I think that I shall never see	 A poem lovely as a tree.	  A tree whose hungry mouth is prest	 Against the earth's sweet flowing breast; 	  A tree that looks at God all day,	         And lifts her leafy arms to pray; 	  A tree that may in summer wear	 A nest of robins in her hair; 	  Upon whose bosom snow has lain; 	 Who intimately lives with rain.	  Poems are made by fools like me,	 But only God can make a tree. 
                        

                        We wear the mask that grins and lies,It hides our cheeks and shades our eyes,--This debt we pay to human guile;With torn and bleeding hearts we smile,And mouth with myriad subtleties.Why should the world be overwise,In counting all our tears and sighs?Nay, let them only see us, whileWe wear the mask.We smile, but, O great Christ, our criesTo thee from tortured souls arise.We sing, but oh the clay is vileBeneath our feet, and long the mile;But let the world dream otherwise,We wear the mask! 
                        

                        Tyger! Tyger! burning bright, In the forests of the night, What immortal hand or eye Could frame thy fearful symmetry? In what distant deeps or skies Burnt the fire of thine eyes? On what wings dare he aspire? What the hand dare sieze the fire? And what shoulder, & what art, Could twist the sinews of thy heart? And when thy heart began to beat, What dread hand? & what dread feet? What the hammer? what the chain? In what furnace was thy brain? What the anvil? what dread grasp Dare its deadly terrors clasp? When the stars threw down their spears, And water'd heaven with their tears, Did he smile his work to see? Did he who made the Lamb make thee? Tyger! Tyger! burning bright In the forests of the night, What immortal hand or eye Dare frame thy fearful symmetry?

                        This girlchild was born as usualand presented dolls that did pee-peeand miniature GE stoves and ironsand wee lipsticks the color of cherry candy.Then in the magic of puberty, a classmate said:You have a great big nose and fat legs. She was healthy, tested intelligent,possessed strong arms and back,abundant sexual drive and manual dexterity.She went to and fro apologizing.Everyone saw a fat nose on thick legs. She was advised to play coy,exhorted to come on hearty,exercise, diet, smile and wheedle.Her good nature wore outlike a fan belt.So she cut off her nose and her legsand offered them up. In the casket displayed on satin she laywith the undertaker's cosmetics painted on,a turned-up putty nose,dressed in a pink and white nightie.Doesn't she look pretty? everyone said.Consummation at last.To every woman a happy ending. 
                        

                        The art of losing isn't hard to master; so many things seem filled with the intentto be lost that their loss is no disaster,Lose something every day. Accept the flusterof lost door keys, the hour badly spent.The art of losing isn't hard to master.Then practice losing farther, losing faster:places, and names, and where it was you meantto travel. None of these will bring disaster.I lost my mother's watch. And look! my last, ornext-to-last, of three loved houses went.The art of losing isn't hard to master.I lost two cities, lovely ones. And, vaster,some realms I owned, two rivers, a continent.I miss them, but it wasn't a disaster.- Even losing you (the joking voice, a gestureI love)    I shan't have lied. It's evidentthe art of losing's not too hard to masterthough it may look like (Write it!)    like disaster. 
                        

                        Beautiful is the 'thank you'Wrapped with gratitude, Offered to peace prone peopleWho offer what is real-themselvesTo nurse  with love and humilitynapalm asphyxiated victims in our stained worldveiling ambition with face ofhumanity.Beautiful is the momentwhen sunlit world fades away And with it mind made mirror While look inward drawn, sight insight led, and heart shuts out desire to let inconsciousness. 
                        

                        Bright star, would I were stedfast as thou art-         Not in lone splendour hung aloft the night   And watching, with eternal lids apart,       Like nature's patient, sleepless Eremite,   The moving waters at their priestlike task       Of pure ablution round earth's human shores,   Or gazing on the new soft-fallen mask       Of snow upon the mountains and the moors-    No- yet still stedfast, still unchangeable,       Pillow'd upon my fair love's ripening breast,   To feel for ever its soft fall and swell,       Awake for ever in a sweet unrest,   Still, still to hear her tender-taken breath,   And so live ever- or else swoon to death. 
                        

                        The Peace Warrior Of Mzansi, among heroes - a colossus! Sun Of The Nation; A rare gift of Providence.Once, entangled in the web of racist succubus; Unruffled he declares before High Justice: '[I]t is an ideal for which I am prepared to die.' Silence -Pregnant with dreadful menace in court ensued.A beast of burden consequent of unshakeable stance.In the slammer Symbol Of The Struggle he attained; But Apartheid demon persisted in its Treachery.'Coalition Of Conscience' inspired outcry for Liberty; Plagues of sanctions shatter manacles of Slavery.Looming on the horizon - a sight of Equality.From abyss of darkness emerged the Institution; The Immortal Icon and Mastermind of Rainbow Nation.NOTE: This compact synopsis of Dr Nelson Madiba Mandela is a story about his journey from The Rivonia Trial (where he was charged with TREASON - an offence carrying death penalty by HANGING) to Freedom and Democracy.He was after much... sentenced to life imprisonment with hard labour. The piece is a poetic portrait of the cosmopolitan juggernaut, whose enigmatic radiance of love was tested far beyond the experience flesh has to endure. It is a soulful tale of the great icon of peaceful resistance, who had gone from prison (for 27 years)to become the first democratically elected President of South Africa.May his wonderful and gentle soul continue to rest in the Bosom Of Almighty God.Mzansi is another name for South Africa - an affectionate name. 
                        

                        Death is nothing at all.I have only slipped away to the next room.I am I and you are you.Whatever we were to each other, That, we still are.Call me by my old familiar name.Speak to me in the easy waywhich you always used.Put no difference into your tone.Wear no forced air of solemnity or sorrow.Laugh as we always laughedat the little jokes we enjoyed together.Play, smile, think of me.  Pray for me.Let my name be ever the household wordthat it always was.Let it be spoken without effect.Without the trace of a shadow on it.Life means all that it ever meant.It is the same that it ever was.There is absolute unbroken continuity.Why should I be out of mindbecause I am out of sight? I am but waiting for you.For an interval.Somewhere. Very near.Just around the corner.All is well.Nothing is past; nothing is lost. One brief moment and all will be as it was before only better, infinitely happier and forever we will all be one together with Christ. 
                        

                        Whenever Richard Cory went down town,We people on the pavement looked at him:He was a gentleman from sole to crown,Clean favored, and imperially slim.And he was always quietly arrayed,And he was always human when he talked; But still he fluttered pulses when he said,'Good-morning,' and he glittered when he walked.And he was rich - yes, richer than a king -And admirably schooled in every grace:In fine, we thought that he was everythingTo make us wish that we were in his place.So on we worked, and waited for the light,And went without the meat, and cursed the bread; And Richard Cory, one calm summer night,Went home and put a bullet through his head. 
                        

                        Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?Thou art more lovely and more temperate.Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,And summer's lease hath all too short a date.Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,And often is his gold complexion dimmed;And every fair from fair sometime declines,By chance, or nature's changing course, untrimmed;But thy eternal summer shall not fade,Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow'st,Nor shall death brag thou wand'rest in his shade,When in eternal lines to Time thou grow'st. So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see, So long lives this, and this gives life to thee. 
                        

                        The neighbors' dog will not stop barking.He is barking the same high, rhythmic barkthat he barks every time they leave the house.They must switch him on on their way out.The neighbors' dog will not stop barking.I close all the windows in the houseand put on a Beethoven symphony full blastbut I can still hear him muffled under the music,barking, barking, barking,and now I can see him sitting in the orchestra,his head raised confidently as if Beethovenhad included a part for barking dog.When the record finally ends he is still barking,sitting there in the oboe section barking,his eyes fixed on the conductor who isentreating him with his batonwhile the other musicians listen in respectfulsilence to the famous barking dog solo,that endless coda that first establishedBeethoven as an innovative genius. 
                        

                        Be glad your nose is on your face,not pasted on some other place,for if it were where it is not,you might dislike your nose a lot.Imagine if your precious nosewere sandwiched in between your toes,that clearly would not be a treat,for you'd be forced to smell your feet.Your nose would be a source of dreadwere it attached atop your head,it soon would drive you to despair,forever tickled by your hair.Within your ear, your nose would bean absolute catastrophe,for when you were obliged to sneeze,your brain would rattle from the breeze.Your nose, instead, through thick and thin,remains between your eyes and chin,not pasted on some other place--be glad your nose is on your face! 
                        

                        I am in need of music that would flowOver my fretful, feeling fingertips,Over my bitter-tainted, trembling lips,With melody, deep, clear, and liquid-slow.Oh, for the healing swaying, old and low,Of some song sung to rest the tired dead,A song to fall like water on my head,And over quivering limbs, dream flushed to glow!There is a magic made by melody:A spell of rest, and quiet breath, and coolHeart, that sinks through fading colors deepTo the subaqueous stillness of the sea,And floats forever in a moon-green pool,Held in the arms of rhythm and of sleep. 
                        

                        A woman who my mother knowsCame in and took off all her clothes.Said I, not being very old,'By golly gosh, you must be cold!''No, no!' she cried. 'Indeed I'm not!I'm feeling devilishly hot!' 
                        

                        Take some Picts, Celts and SiluresAnd let them settle,Then overrun them with Roman conquerors. Remove the Romans after approximately 400 yearsAdd lots of Norman French to someAngles, Saxons, Jutes and Vikings, then stir vigorously. Mix some hot Chileans, cool Jamaicans, Dominicans,Trinidadians and Bajans with some Ethiopians, Chinese,Vietnamese and Sudanese. Then take a blend of Somalians, Sri Lankans, NigeriansAnd Pakistanis, Combine with some GuyaneseAnd turn up the heat. Sprinkle some fresh Indians, Malaysians, Bosnians,Iraqis and Bangladeshis together with someAfghans, Spanish, Turkish, Kurdish, JapaneseAnd Palestinians Then add to the melting pot. Leave the ingredients to simmer. As they mix and blend allow their languages to flourishBinding them together with English. Allow time to be cool.Add some unity, understanding, and respect for the future,Serve with justiceAnd enjoy. Note: All the ingredients are equally important. Treating one ingredient better than another will leave a bitter unpleasant taste.Warning: An unequal spread of justice will damage the people and cause pain. Give justice and equality to all. 
                        

                        Isabel met an enormous bear,Isabel, Isabel, didn't care;The bear was hungry, the bear was ravenous,The bear's big mouth was cruel and cavernous.The bear said, Isabel, glad to meet you,How do, Isabel, now I'll eat you!Isabel, Isabel, didn't worry.Isabel didn't scream or scurry.She washed her hands and she straightened her hair up,Then Isabel quietly ate the bear up.Once in a night as black as pitchIsabel met a wicked old witch.the witch's face was cross and wrinkled,The witch's gums with teeth were sprinkled.Ho, ho, Isabel! the old witch crowed,I'll turn you into an ugly toad!Isabel, Isabel, didn't worry,Isabel didn't scream or scurry,She showed no rage and she showed no rancor,But she turned the witch into milk and drank her.Isabel met a hideous giant,Isabel continued self reliant.The giant was hairy, the giant was horrid,He had one eye in the middle of his forhead.Good morning, Isabel, the giant said,I'll grind your bones to make my bread.Isabel, Isabel, didn't worry,Isabel didn't scream or scurry.She nibled the zwieback that she always fed off,And when it was gone, she cut the giant's head off.Isabel met a troublesome doctor,He punched and he poked till he really shocked her.The doctor's talk was of coughs and chillsAnd the doctor's satchel bulged with pills.The doctor said unto Isabel,Swallow this, it will make you well.Isabel, Isabel, didn't worry,Isabel didn't scream or scurry.She took those pills from the pill concocter,And Isabel calmly cured the doctor. 
                        

                        The whole idea of it makes me feellike I'm coming down with something,something worse than any stomach acheor the headaches I get from reading in bad light--a kind of measles of the spirit,a mumps of the psyche,a disfiguring chicken pox of the soul.You tell me it is too early to be looking back,but that is because you have forgottenthe perfect simplicity of being oneand the beautiful complexity introduced by two.But I can lie on my bed and remember every digit.At four I was an Arabian wizard.I could make myself invisibleby drinking a glass of milk a certain way.At seven I was a soldier, at nine a prince.But now I am mostly at the windowwatching the late afternoon light.Back then it never fell so solemnlyagainst the side of my tree house,and my bicycle never leaned against the garageas it does today,all the dark blue speed drained out of it.This is the beginning of sadness, I say to myself,as I walk through the universe in my sneakers.It is time to say good-bye to my imaginary friends,time to turn the first big number.It seems only yesterday I used to believethere was nothing under my skin but light.If you cut me I could shine.But now when I fall upon the sidewalks of life,I skin my knees. I bleed. 
                        

                        Death be not proud, though some have called theeMighty and dreadfull, for, thou art not soe,For, those, whom thou think'st, thou dost overthrow,Die not, poore death, nor yet canst thou kill mee.From rest and sleepe, which but thy pictures bee,Much pleasure, then from thee, much more must flow,And soonest our best men with thee doe goe,Rest of their bones, and soules deliverie.Thou art slave to Fate, Chance, kings, and desperate men,And dost with poyson, warre, and sicknesse dwell,And poppie, or charmes can make us sleepe as well,And better then thy stroake; why swell'st thou then?One short sleepe past, wee wake eternally,And death shall be no more; death, thou shalt die. 
                        

                        Last night I dreamed of chickens,there were chickens everywhere,they were standing on my stomach,they were nesting in my hair,they were pecking at my pillow,they were hopping on my head,they were ruffling up their feathersas they raced about my bed.They were on the chairs and tables,they were on the chandeliers,they were roosting in the corners,they were clucking in my ears,there were chickens, chickens, chickensfor as far as I could see...when I woke today, I noticedthere were eggs on top of me. 
                        

                        Laugh, and the world laughs with you; Weep, and you weep alone.For the sad old earth must borrow its mirth,But has trouble enough of its own.Sing, and the hills will answer; Sigh, it is lost on the air.The echoes bound to a joyful sound,But shrink from voicing care.Rejoice, and men will seek you; Grieve, and they turn and go.They want full measure of all your pleasure,But they do not need your woe.Be glad, and your friends are many; Be sad, and you lose them all.There are none to decline your nectared wine,But alone you must drink life's gall.Feast, and your halls are crowded; Fast, and the world goes by.Succeed and give, and it helps you live,But no man can help you die.There is room in the halls of pleasureFor a long and lordly train,But one by one we must all file onThrough the narrow aisles of pain. 
                        

                        WHEN you are old and grey and full of sleep,And nodding by the fire, take down this book,And slowly read, and dream of the soft lookYour eyes had once, and of their shadows deep;How many loved your moments of glad grace,And loved your beauty with love false or true,But one man loved the pilgrim Soul in you,And loved the sorrows of your changing face;And bending down beside the glowing bars,Murmur, a little sadly, how Love fledAnd paced upon the mountains overheadAnd hid his face amid a crowd of stars. 
                        

                        The name of the author is the first to gofollowed obediently by the title, the plot,the heartbreaking conclusion, the entire novelwhich suddenly becomes one you have never read,never even heard of,as if, one by one, the memories you used to harbordecided to retire to the southern hemisphere of the brain,to a little fishing village where there are no phones.Long ago you kissed the names of the nine Muses goodbyeand watched the quadratic equation pack its bag,and even now as you memorize the order of the planets,something else is slipping away, a state flower perhaps,the address of an uncle, the capital of Paraguay.Whatever it is you are struggling to remember,it is not poised on the tip of your tongue,not even lurking in some obscure corner of your spleen.It has floated away down a dark mythological riverwhose name begins with an L as far as you can recall,well on your own way to oblivion where you will join thosewho have even forgotten how to swim and how to ride a bicycle.No wonder you rise in the middle of the nightto look up the date of a famous battle in a book on war.No wonder the moon in the window seems to have driftedout of a love poem that you used to know by heart. 
                        

                        O my Luve's like a red, red roseThat's newly sprung in June; O my Luve's like the melodieThat's sweetly play'd in tune.As fair art thou, my bonnie lass,So deep in luve am I:And I will luve thee still, my dear,Till a' the seas gang dry:Till a' the seas gang dry, my dear,And the rocks melt wi' the sun:I will luve thee still, my dear,While the sands o' life shall run.And fare thee well, my only LuveAnd fare thee well, a while! And I will come again, my Luve,Tho' it were ten thousand mile. 
                        

                        No earthquake, no thunder, no volcanic eruptionOr even there was not any of other natural calamities, A sudden loud sound broke out all through the bushWith whizzing, shuddering, cracking, tearing, echoing, Fear, horror, dark, terror, misery and ill spirits spreadCommitting destruction, death in a horrible situation, Dust, dirt, smoke coiled over the whole atmosphereThe harmless animals are quite perplexed, helplessThey began crying, shouting, running, rushing, faintingSeeing reddish spots and innumerable torn bodies.They blamed one another for committing the crime, Brawling, harming, plotting hardened in them, A long conflict complicated and awful tangledLoosing the worms of crime, injustice and corruption; The virtues sunk and the vices rose everywhereEnvious state of barbarism, terrorism inflicted on them; The poor animals lost peace and principles they hadCenturies curses engulfed all what was out of thought.Ferocious animals are in the neighboring big forestWho always wait for chances on the helpless ones; They do not care for hesitating in violating terms Committing all sorts of hyenas and monstrous harms; They know how and when to cook poisonous brothAnd how to throw an unseen net to catch the rest.Once some cats were quarrelling nearby the bushSome wild dogs of the big forest made an instant rush, For repeated barking mewing was beyond of hearingFoxes and monkeys also joined within a quick hasteCrows, kites and vultures started crowing for the feastWhat more, rats and mice left the bush being frightenedDreadful tumult, commotion, collision, conflict took place At the arrival of buffalos, deer, bears, wolfs and hyenas; But with sudden and unexpected appearance ofJaguars, lions, tigers and some bears' rejoining to themReturning from the herd of small and weak beastsConsisting boars, wolfs, hyenas, wild pigs and dogs, Though wolfs and hyenas started loudly barkingBut came to no use and got chased, retreated soon, All the surroundings became instant silent and isolated, All went away murmuring without more looking back.The victorious were excited having got all easy victory, But they found troubles to enjoy the whole empire lonely, So there were roaring, shouting, blustering, threateningOf occupying empire, power, lordship and over lordship, Finally, all the bestial rules with ‘Might is right' wereEstablished in rules and regulations less animal state.Copyright © Muzahidul Reza | 6 October, 2016 
                        

                        I loved you, and I probably still do,And for a while the feeling may remain...But let my love no longer trouble you,I do not wish to cause you any pain.I loved you; and the hopelessness I knew,The jealousy, the shyness - though in vain -Made up a love so tender and so trueAs may God grant you to be loved again.Translated by Genia Gurarie, 11/10/95 
                        

                        THIS is thy hour O Soul, thy free flight into the wordless,   Away from books, away from art, the day erased, the lesson done,   Thee fully forth emerging, silent, gazing, pondering the themes thou         lovest best.   Night, sleep, death and the stars. 
                        

                        If you die before meI would jump down into your graveand hug you so innocentlythat angels will become jealous.I shall kiss you.So intimately shall I kiss youthat your breath becomes mine.In one breath of love shall we merge into hugs of true joy.Your heart shall beatin rhythms unheardlike the drums of the desertand the wild forest in the night.You shall murmur in my ears: 'Ohpress me to your chest; Tear open your chest, Make way for me to enter into your loving heartthat beats only for me in resounding colors.Tell me please Oh my loverIs it a rainbow that I see? or the glow of a burning pyre? Why is it that I cannot utter it in words? Tell me glorious angels of love: What am I experiencing in uncountablemoments of indescribable inner comfort? Shivering in your presenceI shall long to dance with you.If the dark souls lead you to HadesI will dance and dance with youeven in the nether world.We shall dance soft and then wild.We shall dance togetheras one body and soul and break the fetters of hellthrough love that emanates from our dance.Dance so long and fine like a poemuntil the Lords of the dark would faint.Breaking the fetters of Hadesthe white angelsattired in beautyshall fly down to pick you up on golden cradlesand carry you to the world of God.Soyou will be free and fly away from me into the world of the heavenswhere angels shall kiss your sacred body.You will be attired in gold and whiteand in varied colors in tune with the flowers of heaven.Then you need no space to live and breathe.Into that world of purity you will goand I will be here on earthdreaming of your joys with the Heavenly spirits.Shall I wait? Shall I wait at dusk and dawnin sobs and a heaving heartwith such desire and passionto reach you one day in your world of happiness.(It is the belief that once your lady love dies before you, she has to go to the Hades and there she has to dance so fiercely and lovingly to make the Lords of Darkness faint and then she shall be free from the chains of hell.Here the living lover is ready to go to hell to dance with her most fiercely and save her from the hell) 
                        

                        The fountains mingle with the river,     And the rivers with the ocean; The winds of heaven mix forever          With a sweet emotion; Nothing in the world is single;      All things by a law divineIn another's being mingle-           Why not I with thine? See, the mountains kiss high heaven,     And the waves clasp one another; No sister flower could be forgiven          If it disdained its brother; And the sunlight clasps the earth,     And the moonbeams kiss the sea; - What are all these kissings worth,          If thou kiss not me? 
                        

                        "Is there anybody there?" said the Traveller,Knocking on the moonlit door;And his horse in the silence champed the grassOf the forest's ferny floor;And a bird flew up out of the turret,Above the Traveller's head:And he smote upon the door again a second time;"Is there anybody there?" he said.But no one descended to the Traveller;No head from the leaf-fringed sillLeaned over and looked into his grey eyes,Where he stood perplexed and still.But only a host of phantom listenersThat dwelt in the lone house thenStood listening in the quiet of the moonlightTo that voice from the world of men:Stood thronging the faint moonbeams on the dark stair,That goes down to the empty hall,Hearkening in an air stirred and shakenBy the lonely Traveller's call.And he felt in his heart their strangeness,Their stillness answering his cry,While his horse moved, cropping the dark turf,'Neath the starred and leafy sky;For he suddenly smote on the door, evenLouder, and lifted his head:--"Tell them I came, and no one answered,That I kept my word," he said.Never the least stir made the listeners,Though every word he spakeFell echoing through the shadowiness of the still houseFrom the one man left awake:Ay, they heard his foot upon the stirrup,And the sound of iron on stone,And how the silence surged softly backward,When the plunging hoofs were gone.

                        You're sad because you're sad.It's psychic. It's the age. It's chemical.Go see a shrink or take a pill,or hug your sadness like an eyeless dollyou need to sleep.Well, all children are sadbut some get over it.Count your blessings. Better than that,buy a hat. Buy a coat or pet.Take up dancing to forget.Forget what? Your sadness, your shadow,whatever it was that was done to youthe day of the lawn partywhen you came inside flushed with the sun,your mouth sulky with sugar,in your new dress with the ribbonand the ice-cream smear,and said to yourself in the bathroom,I am not the favorite child.My darling, when it comesright down to itand the light fails and the fog rolls inand you're trapped in your overturned bodyunder a blanket or burning car,and the red flame is seeping out of youand igniting the tarmac beside your heador else the floor, or else the pillow,none of us is; or else we all are. 
                        

                        Said Hamlet to Ophelia,I'll draw a sketch of thee,What kind of pencil shall I use? 2B or not 2B? 
                        

                        When I consider how my light is spentEre half my days in this dark world and wide,And that one talent which is death to hideLodg'd with me useless, though my soul more bentTo serve therewith my Maker, and presentMy true account, lest he returning chide,"Doth God exact day-labour, light denied?"I fondly ask. But Patience, to preventThat murmur, soon replies: "God doth not needEither man's work or his own gifts: who bestBear his mild yoke, they serve him best. His stateIs kingly; thousands at his bidding speedAnd post o'er land and ocean without rest:They also serve who only stand and wait." 
                        

                        I am: yet what I am none cares or knows,My friends forsake me like a memory lost; I am the self-consumer of my woes,They rise and vanish in oblivious host,Like shades in love and death's oblivion lost; And yet I am! and live with shadows tostInto the nothingness of scorn and noise,Into the living sea of waking dreams,Where there is neither sense of life nor joys,But the vast shipwreck of my life's esteems; And e'en the dearest- that I loved the best- Are strange- nay, rather stranger than the rest.I long for scenes where man has never trod; A place where woman never smil'd or wept; There to abide with my creator, God,And sleep as I in childhood sweetly slept:Untroubling and untroubled where I lie; The grass below- above the vaulted sky. 
                        

                        HAD I the heavens' embroidered cloths,Enwrought with golden and silver light,The blue and the dim and the dark clothsOf night and light and the half-light,I would spread the cloths under your feet:But I, being poor, have only my dreams;I have spread my dreams under your feet;Tread softly because you tread on my dreams. 
                        

                        One Christmas was so much like another, in those years around the sea-town corner now and out of all sound except the distant speaking of the voices I sometimes hear a moment before sleep, that I can never remember whether it snowed for six days and six nights when I was twelve or whether it snowed for twelve days and twelve nights when I was six.All the Christmases roll down toward the two-tongued sea, like a cold and headlong moon bundling down the sky that was our street; and they stop at the rim of the ice-edged fish-freezing waves, and I plunge my hands in the snow and bring out whatever I can find. In goes my hand into that wool-white bell-tongued ball of holidays resting at the rim of the carol-singing sea, and out come Mrs. Prothero and the firemen.It was on the afternoon of the Christmas Eve, and I was in Mrs. Prothero's garden, waiting for cats, with her son Jim. It was snowing. It was always snowing at Christmas. December, in my memory, is white as Lapland, though there were no reindeers. But there were cats. Patient, cold and callous, our hands wrapped in socks, we waited to snowball the cats. Sleek and long as jaguars and horrible-whiskered, spitting and snarling, they would slink and sidle over the white back-garden walls, and the lynx-eyed hunters, Jim and I, fur-capped and moccasined trappers from Hudson Bay, off Mumbles Road, would hurl our deadly snowballs at the green of their eyes. The wise cats never appeared.We were so still, Eskimo-footed arctic marksmen in the muffling silence of the eternal snows - eternal, ever since Wednesday - that we never heard Mrs. Prothero's first cry from her igloo at the bottom of the garden. Or, if we heard it at all, it was, to us, like the far-off challenge of our enemy and prey, the neighbor's polar cat. But soon the voice grew louder."Fire!" cried Mrs. Prothero, and she beat the dinner-gong.And we ran down the garden, with the snowballs in our arms, toward the house; and smoke, indeed, was pouring out of the dining-room, and the gong was bombilating, and Mrs. Prothero was announcing ruin like a town crier in Pompeii. This was better than all the cats in Wales standing on the wall in a row. We bounded into the house, laden with snowballs, and stopped at the open door of the smoke-filled room.Something was burning all right; perhaps it was Mr. Prothero, who always slept there after midday dinner with a newspaper over his face. But he was standing in the middle of the room, saying, "A fine Christmas!" and smacking at the smoke with a slipper."Call the fire brigade," cried Mrs. Prothero as she beat the gong."There won't be there," said Mr. Prothero, "it's Christmas."There was no fire to be seen, only clouds of smoke and Mr. Prothero standing in the middle of them, waving his slipper as though he were conducting."Do something," he said. And we threw all our snowballs into the smoke - I think we missed Mr. Prothero - and ran out of the house to the telephone box."Let's call the police as well," Jim said. "And the ambulance." "And Ernie Jenkins, he likes fires."But we only called the fire brigade, and soon the fire engine came and three tall men in helmets brought a hose into the house and Mr. Prothero got out just in time before they turned it on. Nobody could have had a noisier Christmas Eve. And when the firemen turned off the hose and were standing in the wet, smoky room, Jim's Aunt, Miss. Prothero, came downstairs and peered in at them. Jim and I waited, very quietly, to hear what she would say to them. She said the right thing, always. She looked at the three tall firemen in their shining helmets, standing among the smoke and cinders and dissolving snowballs, and she said, "Would you like anything to read?"Years and years ago, when I was a boy, when there were wolves in Wales, and birds the color of red-flannel petticoats whisked past the harp-shaped hills, when we sang and wallowed all night and day in caves that smelt like Sunday afternoons in damp front farmhouse parlors, and we chased, with the jawbones of deacons, the English and the bears, before the motor car, before the wheel, before the duchess-faced horse, when we rode the daft and happy hills bareback, it snowed and it snowed. But here a small boy says: "It snowed last year, too. I made a snowman and my brother knocked it down and I knocked my brother down and then we had tea.""But that was not the same snow," I say. "Our snow was not only shaken from white wash buckets down the sky, it came shawling out of the ground and swam and drifted out of the arms and hands and bodies of the trees; snow grew overnight on the roofs of the houses like a pure and grandfather moss, minutely -ivied the walls and settled on the postman, opening the gate, like a dumb, numb thunder-storm of white, torn Christmas cards.""Were there postmen then, too?""With sprinkling eyes and wind-cherried noses, on spread, frozen feet they crunched up to the doors and mittened on them manfully. But all that the children could hear was a ringing of bells.""You mean that the postman went rat-a-tat-tat and the doors rang?""I mean that the bells the children could hear were inside them.""I only hear thunder sometimes, never bells.""There were church bells, too.""Inside them?""No, no, no, in the bat-black, snow-white belfries, tugged by bishops and storks. And they rang their tidings over the bandaged town, over the frozen foam of the powder and ice-cream hills, over the crackling sea. It seemed that all the churches boomed for joy under my window; and the weathercocks crew for Christmas, on our fence.""Get back to the postmen""They were just ordinary postmen, found of walking and dogs and Christmas and the snow. They knocked on the doors with blue knuckles ....""Ours has got a black knocker....""And then they stood on the white Welcome mat in the little, drifted porches and huffed and puffed, making ghosts with their breath, and jogged from foot to foot like small boys wanting to go out.""And then the presents?""And then the Presents, after the Christmas box. And the cold postman, with a rose on his button-nose, tingled down the tea-tray-slithered run of the chilly glinting hill. He went in his ice-bound boots like a man on fishmonger's slabs. "He wagged his bag like a frozen camel's hump, dizzily turned the corner on one foot, and, by God, he was gone.""Get back to the Presents.""There were the Useful Presents: engulfing mufflers of the old coach days, and mittens made for giant sloths; zebra scarfs of a substance like silky gum that could be tug-o'-warred down to the galoshes; blinding tam-o'-shanters like patchwork tea cozies and bunny-suited busbies and balaclavas for victims of head-shrinking tribes; from aunts who always wore wool next to the skin there were mustached and rasping vests that made you wonder why the aunts had any skin left at all; and once I had a little crocheted nose bag from an aunt now, alas, no longer whinnying with us. And pictureless books in which small boys, though warned with quotations not to, would skate on Farmer Giles' pond and did and drowned; and books that told me everything about the wasp, except why.""Go on the Useless Presents.""Bags of moist and many-colored jelly babies and a folded flag and a false nose and a tram-conductor's cap and a machine that punched tickets and rang a bell; never a catapult; once, by mistake that no one could explain, a little hatchet; and a celluloid duck that made, when you pressed it, a most unducklike sound, a mewing moo that an ambitious cat might make who wished to be a cow; and a painting book in which I could make the grass, the trees, the sea and the animals any colour I pleased, and still the dazzling sky-blue sheep are grazing in the red field under the rainbow-billed and pea-green birds. Hardboileds, toffee, fudge and allsorts, crunches, cracknels, humbugs, glaciers, marzipan, and butterwelsh for the Welsh. And troops of bright tin soldiers who, if they could not fight, could always run. And Snakes-and-Families and Happy Ladders. And Easy Hobbi-Games for Little Engineers, complete with instructions. Oh, easy for Leonardo! And a whistle to make the dogs bark to wake up the old man next door to make him beat on the wall with his stick to shake our picture off the wall. And a packet of cigarettes: you put one in your mouth and you stood at the corner of the street and you waited for hours, in vain, for an old lady to scold you for smoking a cigarette, and then with a smirk you ate it. And then it was breakfast under the balloons.""Were there Uncles like in our house?""There are always Uncles at Christmas. The same Uncles. And on Christmas morning, with dog-disturbing whistle and sugar fags, I would scour the swatched town for the news of the little world, and find always a dead bird by the Post Office or by the white deserted swings; perhaps a robin, all but one of his fires out. Men and women wading or scooping back from chapel, with taproom noses and wind-bussed cheeks, all albinos, huddles their stiff black jarring feathers against the irreligious snow. Mistletoe hung from the gas brackets in all the front parlors; there was sherry and walnuts and bottled beer and crackers by the dessertspoons; and cats in their fur-abouts watched the fires; and the high-heaped fire spat, all ready for the chestnuts and the mulling pokers. Some few large men sat in the front parlors, without their collars, Uncles almost certainly, trying their new cigars, holding them out judiciously at arms' length, returning them to their mouths, coughing, then holding them out again as though waiting for the explosion; and some few small aunts, not wanted in the kitchen, nor anywhere else for that matter, sat on the very edge of their chairs, poised and brittle, afraid to break, like faded cups and saucers."Not many those mornings trod the piling streets: an old man always, fawn-bowlered, yellow-gloved and, at this time of year, with spats of snow, would take his constitutional to the white bowling green and back, as he would take it wet or fire on Christmas Day or Doomsday; sometimes two hale young men, with big pipes blazing, no overcoats and wind blown scarfs, would trudge, unspeaking, down to the forlorn sea, to work up an appetite, to blow away the fumes, who knows, to walk into the waves until nothing of them was left but the two furling smoke clouds of their inextinguishable briars. Then I would be slap-dashing home, the gravy smell of the dinners of others, the bird smell, the brandy, the pudding and mince, coiling up to my nostrils, when out of a snow-clogged side lane would come a boy the spit of myself, with a pink-tipped cigarette and the violet past of a black eye, cocky as a bullfinch, leering all to himself.I hated him on sight and sound, and would be about to put my dog whistle to my lips and blow him off the face of Christmas when suddenly he, with a violet wink, put his whistle to his lips and blew so stridently, so high, so exquisitely loud, that gobbling faces, their cheeks bulged with goose, would press against their tinsled windows, the whole length of the white echoing street. For dinner we had turkey and blazing pudding, and after dinner the Uncles sat in front of the fire, loosened all buttons, put their large moist hands over their watch chains, groaned a little and slept. Mothers, aunts and sisters scuttled to and fro, bearing tureens. Auntie Bessie, who had already been frightened, twice, by a clock-work mouse, whimpered at the sideboard and had some elderberry wine. The dog was sick. Auntie Dosie had to have three aspirins, but Auntie Hannah, who liked port, stood in the middle of the snowbound back yard, singing like a big-bosomed thrush. I would blow up balloons to see how big they would blow up to; and, when they burst, which they all did, the Uncles jumped and rumbled. In the rich and heavy afternoon, the Uncles breathing like dolphins and the snow descending, I would sit among festoons and Chinese lanterns and nibble dates and try to make a model man-o'-war, following the Instructions for Little Engineers, and produce what might be mistaken for a sea-going tramcar.Or I would go out, my bright new boots squeaking, into the white world, on to the seaward hill, to call on Jim and Dan and Jack and to pad through the still streets, leaving huge footprints on the hidden pavements."I bet people will think there's been hippos.""What would you do if you saw a hippo coming down our street?""I'd go like this, bang! I'd throw him over the railings and roll him down the hill and then I'd tickle him under the ear and he'd wag his tail.""What would you do if you saw two hippos?"Iron-flanked and bellowing he-hippos clanked and battered through the scudding snow toward us as we passed Mr. Daniel's house."Let's post Mr. Daniel a snow-ball through his letter box.""Let's write things in the snow.""Let's write, 'Mr. Daniel looks like a spaniel' all over his lawn."Or we walked on the white shore. "Can the fishes see it's snowing?"The silent one-clouded heavens drifted on to the sea. Now we were snow-blind travelers lost on the north hills, and vast dewlapped dogs, with flasks round their necks, ambled and shambled up to us, baying "Excelsior." We returned home through the poor streets where only a few children fumbled with bare red fingers in the wheel-rutted snow and cat-called after us, their voices fading away, as we trudged uphill, into the cries of the dock birds and the hooting of ships out in the whirling bay. And then, at tea the recovered Uncles would be jolly; and the ice cake loomed in the center of the table like a marble grave. Auntie Hannah laced her tea with rum, because it was only once a year.Bring out the tall tales now that we told by the fire as the gaslight bubbled like a diver. Ghosts whooed like owls in the long nights when I dared not look over my shoulder; animals lurked in the cubbyhole under the stairs and the gas meter ticked. And I remember that we went singing carols once, when there wasn't the shaving of a moon to light the flying streets. At the end of a long road was a drive that led to a large house, and we stumbled up the darkness of the drive that night, each one of us afraid, each one holding a stone in his hand in case, and all of us too brave to say a word. The wind through the trees made noises as of old and unpleasant and maybe webfooted men wheezing in caves. We reached the black bulk of the house. "What shall we give them? Hark the Herald?""No," Jack said, "Good King Wencelas. I'll count three." One, two three, and we began to sing, our voices high and seemingly distant in the snow-felted darkness round the house that was occupied by nobody we knew. We stood close together, near the dark door. Good King Wencelas looked out On the Feast of Stephen ... And then a small, dry voice, like the voice of someone who has not spoken for a long time, joined our singing: a small, dry, eggshell voice from the other side of the door: a small dry voice through the keyhole. And when we stopped running we were outside our house; the front room was lovely; balloons floated under the hot-water-bottle-gulping gas; everything was good again and shone over the town."Perhaps it was a ghost," Jim said. "Perhaps it was trolls," Dan said, who was always reading."Let's go in and see if there's any jelly left," Jack said. And we did that.Always on Christmas night there was music. An uncle played the fiddle, a cousin sang "Cherry Ripe," and another uncle sang "Drake's Drum." It was very warm in the little house. Auntie Hannah, who had got on to the parsnip wine, sang a song about Bleeding Hearts and Death, and then another in which she said her heart was like a Bird's Nest; and then everybody laughed again; and then I went to bed. Looking through my bedroom window, out into the moonlight and the unending smoke-colored snow, I could see the lights in the windows of all the other houses on our hill and hear the music rising from them up the long, steady falling night. I turned the gas down, I got into bed. I said some words to the close and holy darkness, and then I slept. 
                        

                        «Let this fluffy snow fall upon ourDreams and make them shine! »Set free, Your breath smoothens unshaken skies; Your perception scratches unopened realities.Is it a diversion -maybe- for lost thoughts, For lost faces and sins? Looking the other way out of fear or Embarrassment, waking up next morning, You should then learnHow to keep alive the drowsing mind, While trying to shove awayHer plait of hair, Jammed in the eyes of memory.Ah.. Those haunting memories! Was her pain realWhen she asserted  «That one is my spoiled dress! My party dressWhich your eyes, filled with lust, tore off of me..»? Hardly a twist of fate thatMultivalent perception which madeVisionary  —FancifulYour unnecessary waiting.Because she didn't come back.Even at dawn. Even in your expectation.Now your pain screams only through silenceWhen you sink your fingers deepInto your bleeding heart  —A sheer griefWith no voice anymoreBecause day in day out, year after yearEverything becomes habit.Until, Gazing at the fluffy snow falling, youCaught a glimpse of her  —Along with aWhiff of her perfume..Peering deeply into your eyesShe spoke words of hopeAlong with a promise -possibly-: « A new life is looming beyond the whitenedFields of your mind »Hushed words, uttered under her breath, Not to scrape the purity of the night.Was it a prophecy? The celebration of a triumph or aFailure  —A bloodcurdling nightmare? Enough! I'm fed up! I stare at my bloody fingersAnd faintly sigh.(Florence,2014)               Copyright © Fabrizio Frosini - All rights reserved 
                        

                        I knew a simple soldier boyWho grinned at life in empty joy,Slept soundly through the lonesome dark,And whistled early with the lark.In winter trenches, cowed and glum,With crumps and lice and lack of rum,He put a bullet through his brain.No one spoke of him again.You smug-faced crowds with kindling eyeWho cheer when soldier lads march by,Sneak home and pray you'll never knowThe hell where youth and laughter go.

                        The sea is calm to-night.The tide is full, the moon lies fairUpon the straits; - on the French coast the lightGleams and is gone; the cliffs of England stand,Glimmering and vast, out in the tranquil bay.Come to the window, sweet is the night-air! Only, from the long line of sprayWhere the sea meets the moon-blanch'd land,Listen! you hear the grating roarOf pebbles which the waves draw back, and fling,At their return, up the high strand,Begin, and cease, and then again begin,With tremulous cadence slow, and bringThe eternal note of sadness in.Sophocles long agoHeard it on the {AE}gean, and it broughtInto his mind the turbid ebb and flowOf human misery; weFind also in the sound a thought,Hearing it by this distant northern sea.The Sea of FaithWas once, too, at the full, and round earth's shoreLay like the folds of a bright girdle furl'd.But now I only hearIts melancholy, long, withdrawing roar,Retreating, to the breathOf the night-wind, down the vast edges drearAnd naked shingles of the world.Ah, love, let us be trueTo one another! for the world, which seemsTo lie before us like a land of dreams,So various, so beautiful, so new,Hath really neither joy, nor love, nor light,Nor certitude, nor peace, nor help for pain; And we are here as on a darkling plainSwept with confused alarms of struggle and flight,Where ignorant armies clash by night. 
                        

                        Abou Ben Adhem (may his tribe increase!)Awoke one night from a deep dream of peace,And saw, within the moonlight in his room,Making it rich, and like a lily in bloom,An angel writing in a book of gold:— Exceeding peace had made Ben Adhem bold,And to the Presence in the room he said"What writest thou?"—The vision raised its head,And with a look made of all sweet accord,Answered "The names of those who love the Lord.""And is mine one?" said Abou. "Nay, not so,"Replied the angel. Abou spoke more low,But cheerly still, and said "I pray thee, then,Write me as one that loves his fellow men."The angel wrote, and vanished. The next nightIt came again with a great wakening light,And showed the names whom love of God had blessed,And lo! Ben Adhem's name led all the rest.Anonymous Submission 
                        

                        What is this life if, full of care,We have no time to stand and stare.No time to stand beneath the boughsAnd stare as long as sheep or cows.No time to see, when woods we pass,Where squirrels hide their nuts in grass.No time to see, in broad daylight,Streams full of stars, like skies at night.No time to turn at Beauty's glance,And watch her feet, how they can dance.No time to wait till her mouth canEnrich that smile her eyes began.A poor life this is if, full of care,We have no time to stand and stare. 
                        

                        Sweet moment, stay with me, and pray do not flee so soon, Let me enjoy the bliss of thatfirst kiss beneath the moon.I wish to cradle this feeling, that has only just been found, A feeling that has unexpectedlyturned my world around.Do not depart, Oh please remainwithin my heart awhile, So that I can savour you once more, and hold you in my smile. 
                        

                        The moment when, after many yearsof hard work and a long voyageyou stand in the centre of your room,house, half-acre, square mile, island, country,knowing at last how you got there,and say, I own this,is the same moment when the trees unloosetheir soft arms from around you,the birds take back their language,the cliffs fissure and collapse,the air moves back from you like a waveand you can't breathe.No, they whisper. You own nothing.You were a visitor, time after timeclimbing the hill, planting the flag, proclaiming.We never belonged to you.You never found us.It was always the other way round. 
                        

                        All you who sleep tonightFar from the ones you love,No hand to left or rightAnd emptiness above -Know that you aren't aloneThe whole world shares your tears,Some for two nights or one,And some for all their years. 
                        

                        I think awhile of Love, and while I think, Love is to me a world, Sole meat and sweetest drink, And close connecting link Tween heaven and earth. I only know it is, not how or why, My greatest happiness; However hard I try, Not if I were to die, Can I explain. I fain would ask my friend how it can be, But when the time arrives, Then Love is more lovely Than anything to me, And so I'm dumb. For if the truth were known, Love cannot speak, But only thinks and does; Though surely out 'twill leak Without the help of Greek, Or any tongue. A man may love the truth and practise it, Beauty he may admire, And goodness not omit, As much as may befit To reverence. But only when these three together meet, As they always incline, And make one soul the seat, And favorite retreat, Of loveliness; When under kindred shape, like loves and hates And a kindred nature, Proclaim us to be mates, Exposed to equal fates Eternally; And each may other help, and service do, Drawing Love's bands more tight, Service he ne'er shall rue While one and one make two, And two are one; In such case only doth man fully prove Fully as man can do, What power there is in Love His inmost soul to move Resistlessly. ______ Two sturdy oaks I mean, which side by side, Withstand the winter's storm, And spite of wind and tide, Grow up the meadow's pride, For both are strong Above they barely touch, but undermined Down to their deepest source, Admiring you shall find Their roots are intertwined Insep'rably. 
                        

                        Once, when I was young and true,  Someone left me sad-Broke my brittle heart in two;  And that is very bad.Love is for unlucky folk,  Love is but a curse.Once there was a heart I broke;  And that, I think, is worse. 
                        

                        Once riding in old Baltimore,    Heart-filled, head-filled with glee,I saw a Baltimorean    Keep looking straight at me.Now I was eight and very small,    And he was no whit bigger,And so I smiled, but he poked out    His tongue, and called me, 'Nigger.'I saw the whole of Baltimore    From May until December;Of all the things that happened there    That's all that I remember. 
                        

                        'Help, help, ' said a man. 'I'm drowning.''Hang on, ' said a man from the shore.'Help, help, ' said the man. 'I'm not clowning.''Yes, I know, I heard you before.Be patient dear man who is drowning, You, see I've got a disease.I'm waiting for a Doctor J. Browning.So do be patient please.''How long, ' said the man who was drowning. 'Will it take for the Doc to arrive? ''Not very long, ' said the man with the disease. 'Till then try staying alive.''Very well, ' said the man who was drowning. 'I'll try and stay afloat.By reciting the poems of BrowningAnd other things he wrote.''Help, help, ' said the man with the disease, 'I suddenly feel quite ill.''Keep calm.' said the man who was drowning, ' Breathe deeply and lie quite still.''Oh dear, ' said the man with the awful disease. 'I think I'm going to die.''Farewell, ' said the man who was drowning.Said the man with the disease, 'goodbye.'So the man who was drowning, drowndedAnd the man with the disease past away.But apart from that, And a fire in my flat, It's been a very nice day. 
                        

                        Slowly, silently, now the moonWalks the night in her silver shoon;This way, and that, she peers, and seesSilver fruit upon silver trees;One by one the casements catchHer beams beneath the silvery thatch;Couched in his kennel, like a log,With paws of silver sleeps the dog;From their shadowy cote the white breasts peepOf doves in silver feathered sleepA harvest mouse goes scampering by,With silver claws, and silver eye;And moveless fish in the water gleam,By silver reeds in a silver stream. 
                        

                        As soon as Fred gets out of bed,his underwear goes on his head.His mother laughs, "Don't put it there,a head's no place for underwear!"But near his ears, above his brains,is where Fred's underwear remains.At night when Fred goes back to bed,he deftly plucks it off his head.His mother switches off the lightand softly croons, "Good night! Good night!"And then, for reasons no one knows,Fred's underwear goes on his toes. 
                        

                        When I have fears that I may cease to be          Before my pen has glean'd my teeming brain,     Before high-piled books, in charactery,         Hold like rich garners the full ripen'd grain;      When I behold, upon the night's starr'd face,         Huge cloudy symbols of a high romance,     And think that I may never live to trace         Their shadows, with the magic hand of chance;      And when I feel, fair creature of an hour,         That I shall never look upon thee more,     Never have relish in the faery power         Of unreflecting love; - then on the shore     Of the wide world I stand alone, and think     Till love and fame to nothingness do sink.

                        In Flanders fields the poppies blowBetween the crosses, row on row,That mark our place; and in the skyThe larks, still bravely singing, flyScarce heard amid the guns below.We are the Dead. Short days agoWe lived, felt dawn, saw sunset glow,Loved and were loved, and now we lie,In Flanders fields.Take up our quarrel with the foe:To you from failing hands we throwThe torch; be yours to hold it high.If ye break faith with us who dieWe shall not sleep, though poppies growIn Flanders fields. 
                        

                        In Xanadu did Kubla KhanA stately pleasure-dome decree :Where Alph, the sacred river, ranThrough caverns measureless to man     Down to a sunless sea.So twice five miles of fertile groundWith walls and towers were girdled round :And there were gardens bright with sinuous rills,Where blossomed many an incense-bearing tree ;And here were forests ancient as the hills,Enfolding sunny spots of greenery.But oh ! that deep romantic chasm which slantedDown the green hill athwart a cedarn cover !A savage place ! as holy and enchantedAs e'er beneath a waning moon was hauntedBy woman wailing for her demon-lover !And from this chasm, with ceaseless turmoil seething,As if this earth in fast thick pants were breathing,A mighty fountain momently was forced :Amid whose swift half-intermitted burstHuge fragments vaulted like rebounding hail,Or chaffy grain beneath the thresher's flail :And 'mid these dancing rocks at once and everIt flung up momently the sacred river.Five miles meandering with a mazy motionThrough wood and dale the sacred river ran,Then reached the caverns measureless to man,And sank in tumult to a lifeless ocean :And 'mid this tumult Kubla heard from farAncestral voices prophesying war !     The shadow of the dome of pleasure     Floated midway on the waves ;     Where was heard the mingled measure     From the fountain and the caves.It was a miracle of rare device,A sunny pleasure-dome with caves of ice !     A damsel with a dulcimer     In a vision once I saw :     It was an Abyssinian maid,     And on her dulcimer she played,     Singing of Mount Abora.     Could I revive within me     Her symphony and song,     To such a deep delight 'twould win me,That with music loud and long,I would build that dome in air,That sunny dome ! those caves of ice !And all who heard should see them there,And all should cry, Beware ! Beware !His flashing eyes, his floating hair !Weave a circle round him thrice,And close your eyes with holy dread,For he on honey-dew hath fed,And drunk the milk of Paradise. 
                        

                        To keep your marriage brimmingWith love in the loving cup,Whenever you’re wrong, admit it; Whenever you’re right, shut up. 
                        

                        Your pain is the breaking of the shell that encloses your understanding. Even as the stone of the fruit must break, that its heart may stand in the sun, so must you know pain. And could you keep your heart in wonder at the daily miracles of your life, your pain would not seem less wondrous than your joy; And you would accept the seasons of your heart, even as you have always accepted the seasons that pass over your fields. And you would watch with serenity through the winters of your grief. Much of your pain is self-chosen. It is the bitter potion by which the physician within you heals your sick self. Therefore trust the physician, and drink his remedy in silence and tranquillity: For his hand, though heavy and hard, is guided by the tender hand of the Unseen, And the cup he brings, though it burn your lips, has been fashioned of the clay which the Potter has moistened with His own sacred tears. 
                        

                        Praise the spells and bless the charms,I found April in my arms.April golden, April cloudy,Gracious, cruel, tender, rowdy;April soft in flowered languor,April cold with sudden anger,Ever changing, ever true --I love April, I love you. 
                        

                        I caught a tremendous fishand held him beside the boathalf out of water, with my hookfast in a corner of his mouth.He didn't fight.He hadn't fought at all.He hung a grunting weight,battered and venerableand homely. Here and therehis brown skin hung in stripslike ancient wallpaper,and its pattern of darker brownwas like wallpaper:shapes like full-blown rosesstained and lost through age.He was speckled with barnacles,fine rosettes of lime,and infestedwith tiny white sea-lice,and underneath two or threerags of green weed hung down.While his gills were breathing inthe terrible oxygen- the frightening gills,fresh and crisp with blood,that can cut so badly- I thought of the coarse white fleshpacked in like feathers,the big bones and the little bones,the dramatic reds and blacksof his shiny entrails,and the pink swim-bladderlike a big peony.I looked into his eyeswhich were far larger than minebut shallower, and yellowed,the irises backed and packedwith tarnished tinfoilseen through the lensesof old scratched isinglass.They shifted a little, but notto return my stare.- It was more like the tippingof an object toward the light.I admired his sullen face,the mechanism of his jaw,and then I sawthat from his lower lip- if you could call it a lipgrim, wet, and weaponlike,hung five old pieces of fish-line,or four and a wire leaderwith the swivel still attached,with all their five big hooksgrown firmly in his mouth.A green line, frayed at the endwhere he broke it, two heavier lines,and a fine black threadstill crimped from the strain and snapwhen it broke and he got away.Like medals with their ribbonsfrayed and wavering,a five-haired beard of wisdomtrailing from his aching jaw.I stared and staredand victory filled upthe little rented boat,from the pool of bilgewhere oil had spread a rainbowaround the rusted engineto the bailer rusted orange,the sun-cracked thwarts,the oarlocks on their strings,the gunnels- until everythingwas rainbow, rainbow, rainbow! And I let the fish go. 
                        

                        What passing-bells for these who die as cattle? Only the monstrous anger of the guns. Only the stuttering rifles' rapid rattle Can patter out their hasty orisons. No mockeries now for them; no prayers nor bells; Nor any voice of mourning save the choirs, The shrill, demented choirs of wailing shells; And bugles calling for them from sad shires. What candles may be held to speed them all? Not in the hands of boys, but in their eyes Shall shine the holy glimmers of good-byes. The pallor of girls' brows shall be their pall; Their flowers the tenderness of patient minds, And each slow dusk a drawing-down of blinds. 
                        

                        Where are you, my beloved? Are you in that little Paradise, watering the flowers who look upon you As infants look upon the breast of their mothers? Or are you in your chamber where the shrine of Virtue has been placed in your honor, and upon Which you offer my heart and soul as sacrifice? Or amongst the books, seeking human knowledge, While you are replete with heavenly wisdom? Oh companion of my soul, where are you? Are you Praying in the temple? Or calling Nature in the Field, haven of your dreams? Are you in the huts of the poor, consoling the Broken-hearted with the sweetness of your soul, and Filling their hands with your bounty? You are God's spirit everywhere; You are stronger than the ages. Do you have memory of the day we met, when the halo of You spirit surrounded us, and the Angels of Love Floated about, singing the praise of the soul's deed? Do you recollect our sitting in the shade of the Branches, sheltering ourselves from Humanity, as the ribs Protect the divine secret of the heart from injury? Remember you the trails and forest we walked, with hands Joined, and our heads leaning against each other, as if We were hiding ourselves within ourselves? Recall you the hour I bade you farewell, And the Maritime kiss you placed on my lips? That kiss taught me that joining of lips in Love Reveals heavenly secrets which the tongue cannot utter! That kiss was introduction to a great sigh, Like the Almighty's breath that turned earth into man. That sigh led my way into the spiritual world, Announcing the glory of my soul; and there It shall perpetuate until again we meet. I remember when you kissed me and kissed me, With tears coursing your cheeks, and you said, "Earthly bodies must often separate for earthly purpose, And must live apart impelled by worldly intent. "But the spirit remains joined safely in the hands of Love, until death arrives and takes joined souls to God. "Go, my beloved; Love has chosen you her delegate; Over her, for she is Beauty who offers to her follower The cup of the sweetness of life. As for my own empty arms, your love shall remain my Comforting groom; you memory, my Eternal wedding." Where are you now, my other self? Are you awake in The silence of the night? Let the clean breeze convey To you my heart's every beat and affection. Are you fondling my face in your memory? That image Is no longer my own, for Sorrow has dropped his Shadow on my happy countenance of the past. Sobs have withered my eyes which reflected your beauty And dried my lips which you sweetened with kisses. Where are you, my beloved? Do you hear my weeping From beyond the ocean? Do you understand my need? Do you know the greatness of my patience? Is there any spirit in the air capable of conveying To you the breath of this dying youth? Is there any Secret communication between angels that will carry to You my complaint? Where are you, my beautiful star? The obscurity of life Has cast me upon its bosom; sorrow has conquered me. Sail your smile into the air; it will reach and enliven me! Breathe your fragrance into the air; it will sustain me! Where are you, me beloved? Oh, how great is Love! And how little am I! 
                        

                        I ne'er was struck before that hour With love so sudden and so sweet, Her face it bloomed like a sweet flower And stole my heart away complete. My face turned pale as deadly pale. My legs refused to walk away, And when she looked, what could I ail? My life and all seemed turned to clay.And then my blood rushed to my face And took my eyesight quite away, The trees and bushes round the place Seemed midnight at noonday. I could not see a single thing, Words from my eyes did start -- They spoke as chords do from the string, And blood burnt round my heart.Are flowers the winter's choice? Is love's bed always snow? She seemed to hear my silent voice, Not love's appeals to know. I never saw so sweet a face As that I stood before. My heart has left its dwelling-place And can return no more 
                        

                        There are strange things done in the midnight sun    By the men who moil for gold;The Arctic trails have their secret tales    That would make your blood run cold;The Northern Lights have seen queer sights,    But the queerest they ever did seeWas that night on the marge of Lake Lebarge    I cremated Sam McGee.Now Sam McGee was from Tennessee, where the cotton blooms and blows.Why he left his home in the South to roam 'round the Pole, God only knows.He was always cold, but the land of gold seemed to hold him like a spell;Though he'd often say in his homely way that he'd "sooner live in hell".On a Christmas Day we were mushing our way over the Dawson trail.Talk of your cold! through the parka's fold it stabbed like a driven nail.If our eyes we'd close, then the lashes froze till sometimes we couldn't see;It wasn't much fun, but the only one to whimper was Sam McGee.And that very night, as we lay packed tight in our robes beneath the snow,And the dogs were fed, and the stars o'erhead were dancing heel and toe,He turned to me, and "Cap," says he, "I'll cash in this trip, I guess;And if I do, I'm asking that you won't refuse my last request."Well, he seemed so low that I couldn't say no; then he says with a sort of moan:"It's the cursed cold, and it's got right hold till I'm chilled clean through to the bone.Yet 'tain't being dead -- it's my awful dread of the icy grave that pains;So I want you to swear that, foul or fair, you'll cremate my last remains."A pal's last need is a thing to heed, so I swore I would not fail;And we started on at the streak of dawn; but God! he looked ghastly pale.He crouched on the sleigh, and he raved all day of his home in Tennessee;And before nightfall a corpse was all that was left of Sam McGee.There wasn't a breath in that land of death, and I hurried, horror-driven,With a corpse half hid that I couldn't get rid, because of a promise given;It was lashed to the sleigh, and it seemed to say:"You may tax your brawn and brains,But you promised true, and it's up to you to cremate those last remains."Now a promise made is a debt unpaid, and the trail has its own stern code.In the days to come, though my lips were dumb, in my heart how I cursed that load.In the long, long night, by the lone firelight, while the huskies, round in a ring,Howled out their woes to the homeless snows -- O God! how I loathed the thing.And every day that quiet clay seemed to heavy and heavier grow;And on I went, though the dogs were spent and the grub was getting low;The trail was bad, and I felt half mad, but I swore I would not give in;And I'd often sing to the hateful thing, and it hearkened with a grin.Till I came to the marge of Lake Lebarge, and a derelict there lay;It was jammed in the ice, but I saw in a trice it was called the "Alice May".And I looked at it, and I thought a bit, and I looked at my frozen chum;Then "Here," said I, with a sudden cry, "is my cre-ma-tor-eum."Some planks I tore from the cabin floor, and I lit the boiler fire;Some coal I found that was lying around, and I heaped the fuel higher;The flames just soared, and the furnace roared -- such a blaze you seldom see;And I burrowed a hole in the glowing coal, and I stuffed in Sam McGee.Then I made a hike, for I didn't like to hear him sizzle so;And the heavens scowled, and the huskies howled, and the wind began to blow.It was icy cold, but the hot sweat rolled down my cheeks, and I don't know why;And the greasy smoke in an inky cloak went streaking down the sky.I do not know how long in the snow I wrestled with grisly fear;But the stars came out and they danced about ere again I ventured near;I was sick with dread, but I bravely said: "I'll just take a peep inside.I guess he's cooked, and it's time I looked"; . . . then the door I opened wide.And there sat Sam, looking cool and calm, in the heart of the furnace roar;And he wore a smile you could see a mile, and he said: "Please close that door.It's fine in here, but I greatly fear you'll let in the cold and storm --Since I left Plumtree, down in Tennessee, it's the first time I've been warm."There are strange things done in the midnight sun    By the men who moil for gold;The Arctic trails have their secret tales    That would make your blood run cold;The Northern Lights have seen queer sights,    But the queerest they ever did seeWas that night on the marge of Lake Lebarge    I cremated Sam McGee. 
                        

                        If I should die, think only this of me:That there's some corner of a foreign fieldThat is for ever England. There shall beIn that rich earth a richer dust concealed;A dust whom England bore, shaped, made aware,Gave, once, her flowers to love, her ways to roam,A body of England's, breathing English air,Washed by the rivers, blest by suns of home.And think, this heart, all evil shed away,A pulse in the eternal mind, no lessGives somewhere back the thoughts by England given;Her sights and sounds; dreams happy as her day;And laughter, learnt of friends; and gentleness,In hearts at peace, under an English heaven. 
                        

                        A child said, What is the grass? fetching it to me with full	hands;How could I answer the child?. . . .I do not know what it	is any more than he.I guess it must be the flag of my disposition, out of hopeful	green stuff woven.Or I guess it is the handkerchief of the Lord,A scented gift and remembrancer designedly dropped,Bearing the owner's name someway in the corners, that we	may see and remark, and say Whose?Or I guess the grass is itself a child. . . .the produced babe	of the vegetation.Or I guess it is a uniform hieroglyphic,And it means, Sprouting alike in broad zones and narrow	zones,Growing among black folks as among white,Kanuck, Tuckahoe, Congressman, Cuff, I give them the same, I receive them the same.And now it seems to me the beautiful uncut hair of graves.Tenderly will I use you curling grass,It may be you transpire from the breasts of young men,It may be if I had known them I would have loved them;It may be you are from old people and from women, and	from offspring taken soon out of their mother's laps,And here you are the mother's laps.This grass is very dark to be from the white heads of old	mothers,Darker than the colorless beards of old men,Dark to come from under the faint red roofs of mouths.O I perceive after all so many uttering tongues!And I perceive they do not come from the roofs of mouths	for nothing.I wish I could translate the hints about the dead young men	and women,And the hints about old men and mothers, and the offspring	taken soon out of their laps.What do you think has become of the young and old men?What do you think has become of the women and	children?They are alive and well somewhere;The smallest sprouts show there is really no death,And if ever there was it led forward life, and does not wait	at the end to arrest it,And ceased the moment life appeared.All goes onward and outward. . . .and nothing collapses,And to die is different from what any one supposed, and	luckier.

                        Abortions will not let you forget.You remember the children you got that you did not get,The damp small pulps with a little or with no hair,The singers and workers that never handled the air.You will never neglect or beatThem, or silence or buy with a sweet.You will never wind up the sucking-thumbOr scuttle off ghosts that come.You will never leave them, controlling your luscious sigh,Return for a snack of them, with gobbling mother-eye.I have heard in the voices of the wind the voices of my dim killed	children.I have contracted. I have easedMy dim dears at the breasts they could never suck.I have said, Sweets, if I sinned, if I seizedYour luckAnd your lives from your unfinished reach,If I stole your births and your names,Your straight baby tears and your games,Your stilted or lovely loves, your tumults, your marriages, aches,	and your deaths,If I poisoned the beginnings of your breaths,Believe that even in my deliberateness I was not deliberate.Though why should I whine,Whine that the crime was other than mine?--Since anyhow you are dead.Or rather, or instead,You were never made.But that too, I am afraid,Is faulty: oh, what shall I say, how is the truth to be said?You were born, you had body, you died.It is just that you never giggled or planned or cried.Believe me, I loved you all.Believe me, I knew you, though faintly, and I loved, I loved youAll. 
                        

                        THAT crazed girl improvising her music.Her poetry, dancing upon the shore,Her soul in division from itselfClimbing, falling She knew not where,Hiding amid the cargo of a steamship,Her knee-cap broken, that girl I declareA beautiful lofty thing, or a thingHeroically lost, heroically found.No matter what disaster occurredShe stood in desperate music wound,Wound, wound, and she made in her triumphWhere the bales and the baskets layNo common intelligible soundBut sang, 'O sea-starved, hungry sea.' 
                        

                        I am not yet born; O hear me.Let not the bloodsucking bat or the rat or the stoat or the     club-footed ghoul come near me.I am not yet born, console me.I fear that the human race may with tall walls wall me,     with strong drugs dope me, with wise lies lure me,        on black racks rack me, in blood-baths roll me.I am not yet born; provide meWith water to dandle me, grass to grow for me, trees to talk     to me, sky to sing to me, birds and a white light        in the back of my mind to guide me.I am not yet born; forgive meFor the sins that in me the world shall commit, my words     when they speak me, my thoughts when they think me,        my treason engendered by traitors beyond me,           my life when they murder by means of my              hands, my death when they live me.I am not yet born; rehearse meIn the parts I must play and the cues I must take when     old men lecture me, bureaucrats hector me, mountains        frown at me, lovers laugh at me, the white            waves call me to folly and the desert calls              me to doom and the beggar refuses                 my gift and my children curse me.I am not yet born; O hear me,Let not the man who is beast or who thinks he is God     come near me.I am not yet born; O fill meWith strength against those who would freeze my     humanity, would dragoon me into a lethal automaton,        would make me a cog in a machine, a thing with           one face, a thing, and against all those              who would dissipate my entirety, would                 blow me like thistledown hither and                    thither or hither and thither                       like water held in the                          hands would spill me.Let them not make me a stone and let them not spill me.Otherwise kill me. 
                        

                        Come to me in the silence of the night;Come in the speaking silence of a dream;Come with soft rounded cheeks and eyes as brightAs sunlight on a stream;Come back in tears,O memory, hope, love of finished years.O dream how sweet, too sweet, too bitter sweet,Whose wakening should have been in Paradise,Where souls brimfull of love abide and meet;Where thirsting longing eyesWatch the slow doorThat opening, letting in, lets out no more.Yet come to me in dreams, that I may liveMy very life again though cold in death:Come back to me in dreams, that I may givePulse for pulse, breath for breath:Speak low, lean lowAs long ago, my love, how long ago. 
                        

                        Amongst the flowers Iam alone with my pot of winedrinking by myself; then liftingmy cup I asked the moonto drink with me, its reflectionand mine in the wine cup, justthe three of us; then I sighfor the moon cannot drink,and my shadow goes emptily alongwith me never saying a word;with no other friends here, I canbut use these two for company;in the time of happiness, Itoo must be happy with allaround me; I sit and singand it is as if the moonaccompanies me; then if Idance, it is my shadow thatdances along with me; whilestill not drunk, I am gladto make the moon and my shadowinto friends, but then whenI have drunk too much, weall part; yet these arefriends I can always count onthese who have no emotionwhatsoever; I hope that one daywe three will meet again,deep in the Milky Way.

                        My love is like to ice, and I to fire:How comes it then that this her cold so greatIs not dissolved through my so hot desire, But harder grows the more I her entreat?Or how comes it that my exceeding heatIs not allayed by her heart-frozen cold,But that I burn much more in boiling sweat,And feel my flames augmented manifold?What more miraculous thing may be told, That fire, which all things melts, should harden ice,And ice, which is congeal's with senseless cold,Should kindle fire by wonderful device?Such is the power of love in gentle mind,That it can alter all the course of kind.

                        I have fallen from sky, Fallen to the ground, I am the angel of sadness, Angel of lost hopes, Angel of lost dreams, I am the fallen angel, Fear me not, I am here for reason, That reason is to have a second chance in life, That life I was given for a reason, They took my wings, They took me apart made me human, I was the fallen angel, But that fallen angel had one chance in life that she was given, This angel won’t make the same mistakes she made before, This angel will go down the right path that has been chosen for her, This fallen angel know what she has to do to be forgiven. 
                        

                        When despair grows in meand I wake in the night at the least soundin fear of what my life and my children's lives may be,I go and lie down where the wood drakerests in his beauty on the water, and the great heron feeds.I come into the peace of wild thingswho do not tax their lives with forethoughtof grief. I come into the presence of still water.And I feel above me the day-blind starswaiting for their light. For a timeI rest in the grace of the world, and am free. 
                        

                        No one worth possessingCan be quite possessed;Lay that on your heart,My young angry dear;This truth, this hard and precious stone,Lay it on your hot cheek,Let it hide your tear.Hold it like a crystalWhen you are aloneAnd gaze in the depths of the icy stone.Long, look long and you will be blessed:No one worth possessingCan be quite possessed. 
                        

                        Come live with me and be my love,And we will all the pleasures proveThat valleys, groves, hills, and fields,Woods, or steepy mountain yields.And we will sit upon rocks,Seeing the shepherds feed their flocks,By shallow rivers to whose fallsMelodious birds sing madrigals.And I will make thee beds of rosesAnd a thousand fragrant poises,A cap of flowers, and a kirtleEmbroidered all with leaves of myrtle; A gown made of the finest woolWhich from our pretty lambs we pull; Fair lined slippers for the cold,With buckles of the purest gold; A belt of straw and ivy buds,With coral clasps and amber studs; And if these pleasures may thee move,Come live with me, and be my love.The shepherds's swains shall dance and singFor thy delight each May morning:If these delights thy mind may move,Then live with me and be my love. 
                        

                        Let the snake wait underhis weedand the writingbe of words, slow and quick, sharpto strike, quiet to wait,sleepless.-- through metaphor to reconcilethe people and the stones.Compose. (No ideasbut in things) Invent!Saxifrage is my flower that splitsthe rocks. 
                        

                        The whiskey on your breath Could make a small boy dizzy; But I hung on like death: Such waltzing was not easy. We romped until the pans Slid from the kitchen shelf; My mother's countenance Could not unfrown itself. The hand that held my wrist Was battered on one knuckle; At every step you missed My right ear scraped a buckle. You beat time on my head With a palm caked hard by dirt, Then waltzed me off to bed Still clinging to your shirt. 
                        

                        To be in love Is to touch with a lighter hand. In yourself you stretch, you are well. You look at things Through his eyes. A cardinal is red. A sky is blue. Suddenly you know he knows too. He is not there but You know you are tasting together The winter, or a light spring weather. His hand to take your hand is overmuch. Too much to bear. You cannot look in his eyes Because your pulse must not say What must not be said. When he Shuts a door- Is not there_ Your arms are water. And you are free With a ghastly freedom. You are the beautiful half Of a golden hurt. You remember and covet his mouth To touch, to whisper on. Oh when to declare Is certain Death! Oh when to apprize Is to mesmerize, To see fall down, the Column of Gold, Into the commonest ash.Anonymous submission.

                        This game is the way in which slaughter becomes an end in itself. Acta est fabula plauditeThe play has been performed; applaud! Surely, less obvious ways existThe Darkness seeks to manipulate us into its service.Actus non facit reum nisi mens sit rea.The act is not guilty unless the mind is also guilty.Once all of them  have won a very special princess prize, the game is over....and they will never buy another one.....Alis grave nil.Nothing is heavy to those who have wingsAnd maybe we cannot understand what's going on, but we can understand  that the playersskillfully hide behind the walls....They think....Cessante ratione legis cessat ipsa lex.When the reason for the law ceases, the law itself ceases.We seek escape from reality, we undermine our self-esteem.Maybe we are unable to see them, but we need to talk about this.And maybe they do not trust us when we tell them to come to us if they needto talk........about those who become  their victims......Sed ipse Spiritus postulat pro nobis, gemitibus inenarrabilibus.But the same Spirit intercedes incessantly for us, with inexpressible groans.

                        If we must die, let it not be like hogsHunted and penned in an inglorious spot,While round us bark the mad and hungry dogs,Making their mock at our accursèd lot.If we must die, O let us nobly die,So that our precious blood may not be shedIn vain; then even the monsters we defyShall be constrained to honor us though dead!O kinsmen! we must meet the common foe!Though far outnumbered let us show us brave,And for their thousand blows deal one death-blow!What though before us lies the open grave?Like men we'll face the murderous, cowardly pack,Pressed to the wall, dying, but fighting back! 
                        

                        LIFE, believe, is not a dream  So dark as sages say;Oft a little morning rain  Foretells a pleasant day. Sometimes there are clouds of gloom,  But these are transient all;If the shower will make the roses bloom,  O why lament its fall ?     Rapidly, merrily,  Life's sunny hours flit by,    Gratefully, cheerily,  Enjoy them as they fly ! What though Death at times steps in  And calls our Best away ?What though sorrow seems to win,  O'er hope, a heavy sway ?Yet hope again elastic springs,  Unconquered, though she fell;Still buoyant are her golden wings,  Still strong to bear us well.    Manfully, fearlessly,  The day of trial bear,    For gloriously, victoriously,  Can courage quell despair ! 
                        

                        I Found you and I lost you, All on a gleaming day. The day was filled with sunshine, And the land was full of May.A golden bird was singing Its melody divine, I found you and I loved you, And all the world was mine.I found you and I lost you, All on a golden day, But when I dream of you, dear, It is always brimming May. 
                        

                        It little profits that an idle king, By this still hearth, among these barren crags, Match'd with an aged wife, I mete and dole Unequal laws unto a savage race, That hoard, and sleep, and feed, and know not me. I cannot rest from travel; I will drink Life to the lees.  All times I have enjoy'd Greatly, have suffer'd greatly, both with those That loved me, and alone; on shore, and when Thro' scudding drifts the rainy Hyades Vext the dim sea.  I am become a name; For always roaming with a hungry heart Much have I seen and known,-- cities of men And manners, climates, councils, governments, Myself not least, but honor'd of them all,-- And drunk delight of battle with my peers, Far on the ringing plains of windy Troy. I am a part of all that I have met; Yet all experience is an arch wherethro' Gleams that untravell'd world whose margin fades For ever and for ever when I move. How dull it is to pause, to make an end, To rust unburnish'd, not to shine in use! As tho' to breathe were life!  Life piled on life Were all too little, and of one to me Little remains; but every hour is saved >From that eternal silence, something more, A bringer of new things; and vile it were For some three suns to store and hoard myself, And this gray spirit yearning in desire To follow knowledge like a sinking star, Beyond the utmost bound of human thought. This is my son, mine own Telemachus, to whom I leave the sceptre and the isle,-- Well-loved of me, discerning to fulfill This labor, by slow prudence to make mild A rugged people, and thro' soft degrees Subdue them to the useful and the good. Most blameless is he, centred in the sphere Of common duties, decent not to fail In offices of tenderness, and pay Meet adoration to my household gods, When I am gone.  He works his work, I mine. There lies the port; the vessel puffs her sail; There gloom the dark, broad seas.  My mariners, Souls that have toil'd, and wrought, and thought with me,-- That ever with a frolic welcome took The thunder and the sunshine, and opposed Free hearts, free foreheads,-- you and I are old; Old age hath yet his honor and his toil. Death closes all; but something ere the end, Some work of noble note, may yet be done, Not unbecoming men that strove with Gods. The lights begin to twinkle from the rocks; The long day wanes; the slow moon climbs; the deep Moans round with many voices.  Come, my friends. 'T is not too late to seek a newer world. Push off, and sitting well in order smite The sounding furrows; for my purpose holds To sail beyond the sunset, and the baths Of all the western stars, until I die. It may be that the gulfs will wash us down; It may be we shall touch the Happy Isles, And see the great Achilles, whom we knew. Tho' much is taken, much abides; and tho' We are not now that strength which in old days Moved earth and heaven, that which we are, we are,-- One equal temper of heroic hearts, Made weak by time and fate, but strong in will To strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield.

                        A fond kiss, and then we sever;A farewell, and then forever! Deep in heart-wrung tears I'll pledge thee,Warring sighs and groans I'll wage thee.Who shall say that Fortune grieves him,While the star of hope she leaves him?Me, nae cheerfu' twinkle lights me;Dark despair around benights me.I'll ne'er blame my partial fancy,Nothing could resist my Nancy;But to see her was to love her;Love but her, and love forever.Had we never lov'd say kindly,Had we never lov'd say blindly,Never met--or never parted--We had ne'er been broken-hearted.Fare thee well, thou first and fairest!Fare thee well, thou best and dearest!Thine be like a joy and treasure,Peace. enjoyment, love, and pleasure!A fond kiss, and then we sever;A farewell, alas, forever!Deep in heart-wrung tears I'll pledge thee,Warring sighs and groans I'll wage thee! 
                        

                        Yearning for tenderness.The one lost —It's so long -so longSince..The light delves deep in the wateryUnconsciousness of an unnatural essence, Just to find nothing.Longing for what went missing at some pointSomewhere, in the long journey, is a beguilingDead end.Come what may, Pushed from pillar to post —Worn byThe wrinkles on the foreheadWithout destination, LonelinessRegrets what's gone lost, Keeping its scent forever.(Florence,2014)    Copyright © Fabrizio Frosini - All rights reserved 
                        

                        Nobody heard him, the dead man,But still he lay moaning:I was much further out than you thoughtAnd not waving but drowning.Poor chap, he always loved larkingAnd now he's deadIt must have been too cold for him his heart gave way,They said.Oh, no no no, it was too cold always(Still the dead one lay moaning)I was much too far out all my lifeAnd not waving but drowning.

                        It may be misery not to sing at all, And to go silent through the brimming day; It may be misery never to be loved, But deeper griefs than these beset the way.To sing the perfect song, And by a half-tone lost the key, There the potent sorrow, there the grief, The pale, sad staring of Life's Tragedy.To have come near to the perfect love, Not the hot passion of untempered youth, But that which lies aside its vanity, And gives, for thy trusting worship, truth.This, this indeed is to be accursed, For if we mortals love, or if we sing, We count our joys not by what we have, But by what kept us from that perfect thing. 
                        

                        If starry space no limit knows      And sun succeeds to sun,There is no reason to suppose      Our earth the only one.'Mid countless constellations cast      A million worlds may be,With each a God to bless or blast      And steer to destiny. Just think! A million gods or so      To guide each vital stream,With over all to boss the show      A Deity supreme.Such magnitudes oppress my mind;      From cosmic space it swings;So ultimately glad to find      Relief in little things.For look! Within my hollow hand,      While round the earth careens,I hold a single grain of sand      And wonder what it means.Ah! If I had the eyes to see,      And brain to understand,I think Life's mystery might be      Solved in this grain of sand. 
                        

                        I was stepping in to become youngI thought it is nice journey but too longI am afraid and take care not to go wrongI was expecting everything for songI am so much influenced by lady smileShe has entered in life just before while'Life seems to be so interesting and fineI want to dance on floor with glass of wineMiss, you can't be so rude For a word you have made prelude, All warmth and affection you have included Hate and distance you have excluded I never expected you to cast All doubts but trust should not last You were the first to realize it fastReality known but never wore any kind of mast, Your innocence and name is kind to infuse Kind words for me but not meant to confuseTime was for decision but you never refusedAlways stood at right point and crisis defused Even amidst delicate moments You did not offer a word or commentsYou were hurt most but you used simple word, Is it blessings to you or gift from Lord? I loved you most as your dearest friend Still you didn't put any word at the end, Kept me at dark or asked or any excuse Used otherwise it as pretext, denied or refused 'Miss' I miss you but you don't miss, Did not expect from you kind hug or simple kissNot even kind gesture or more of any show Still I miss you and never beat eye brow Will this uncertainty remain or go? Life will be full of remorse but still I would forgoIs there any restriction from your side or embargo? You bear always 'no entry' smile with logo You called on me for good luck and best wishes I remained dead as no water was available for fish, May be it is very hard to swallow for some reasons Why then there should be drought without any season? I was quick to grasp situation, Avoided unwarranted efforts for persuasion, Shock was sudden and heavy but came very late, I did accept it with grace and as part of fateShe didn't become mine for some reasonsI waited simply for spring seasonShe too eagerly longed for strong bondAs I was inclined and very fondShe had everything to looseBut she had no option to chooseWhy did she take extreme step? She always used to call me as sweet babeIt may be her way of thinkingIt left me high and dry with blinkingWhat should I call her sacrifice? A step of dedication or break of promises? 
                        

                        I come from a musical placeWhere they shoot me for my songAnd my brother has been torturedBy my brother in my land.I come from a beautiful placeWhere they hate my shade of skinThey don't like the way I prayAnd they ban free poetry. I come from a beautiful placeWhere girls cannot go to schoolThere you are told what to believeAnd even young boys must grow beards. I come from a great old forestI think it is now a fieldAnd the people I once knewAre not there now. We can all be refugeesNobody is safe,All it takes is a mad leaderOr no rain to bring forth food,We can all be refugeesWe can all be told to go,We can be hated by someoneFor being someone. I come from a beautiful placeWhere the valley floods each yearAnd each year the hurricane tells usThat we must keep moving on. I come from an ancient placeAll my family were born thereAnd I would like to go thereBut I really want to live. I come from a sunny, sandy placeWhere tourists go to darken skinAnd dealers like to sell guns thereI just can't tell you what's the price. I am told I have no country nowI am told I am a lieI am told that modern history booksMay forget my name. We can all be refugeesSometimes it only takes a day,Sometimes it only takes a handshakeOr a paper that is signed.We all came from refugeesNobody simply just appeared,Nobody's here without a struggle,And why should we live in fearOf the weather or the troubles?We all came here from somewhere. 
                        

                        FERRARA.That's my last Duchess painted on the wall,Looking as if she were alive.  I callThat piece a wonder, now: Fr Pandolf's handsWorked busily a day, and there she stands.Will't please you sit and look at her? I said``Fr Pandolf'' by design, for never readStrangers like you that pictured countenance,The depth and passion of its earnest glance,But to myself they turned (since none puts byThe curtain I have drawn for you, but I)And seemed as they would ask me, if they durst,How such a glance came there; so, not the firstAre you to turn and ask thus.  Sir, 'twas notHer husband's presence only, called that spotOf joy into the Duchess' cheek: perhapsFr Pandolf chanced to say ``Her mantle laps``Over my lady's wrist too much,'' or ``Paint``Must never hope to reproduce the faint``Half-flush that dies along her throat:'' such stuffWas courtesy, she thought, and cause enoughFor calling up that spot of joy.  She hadA heart---how shall I say?---too soon made glad,Too easily impressed; she liked whate'erShe looked on, and her looks went everywhere.  Sir, 'twas all one! My favour at her breast,The dropping of the daylight in the West,The bough of cherries some officious foolBroke in the orchard for her, the white muleShe rode with round the terrace---all and eachWould draw from her alike the approving speech,Or blush, at least.  She thanked men,---good! but thankedSomehow---I know not how---as if she rankedMy gift of a nine-hundred-years-old nameWith anybody's gift.  Who'd stoop to blameThis sort of trifling? Even had you skillIn speech---(which I have not)---to make your willQuite clear to such an one, and say, ``Just this``Or that in you disgusts me; here you miss,``Or there exceed the mark''---and if she letHerself be lessoned so, nor plainly setHer wits to yours, forsooth, and made excuse,---E'en then would be some stooping; and I chooseNever to stoop.  Oh sir, she smiled, no doubt,Whene'er I passed her; but who passed withoutMuch the same smile? This grew; I gave commands;Then all smiles stopped together.  There she standsAs if alive.  Will't please you rise? We'll meetThe company below, then.  I repeat,The Count your master's known munificenceIs ample warrant that no just pretenceOf mine for dowry will be disallowed;Though his fair daughter's self, as I avowedAt starting, is my object.  Nay, we'll goTogether down, sir. Notice Neptune, though,Taming a sea-horse, thought a rarity,Which Claus of Innsbruck cast in bronze for me! 
                        

                        LOVE - what is love?  A great and aching heart;Wrung hands; and silence; and a long despair.Life - what is life?  Upon a moorland bareTo see love coming and see love depart. 
                        

                        This is the place.  Stand still, my steed,  Let me review the scene,And summon from the shadowy Past  The forms that once have been.The Past and Present here unite  Beneath Time's flowing tide,Like footprints hidden by a brook,  But seen on either side.Here runs the highway to the town;  There the green lane descends,Through which I walked to church with thee,  O gentlest of my friends!The shadow of the linden-trees  Lay moving on the grass;Between them and the moving boughs,  A shadow, thou didst pass.Thy dress was like the lilies,  And thy heart as pure as they:One of God's holy messengers  Did walk with me that day.I saw the branches of the trees  Bend down thy touch to meet,The clover-blossoms in the grass  Rise up to kiss thy feet,"Sleep, sleep to-day, tormenting cares,  Of earth and folly born!"Solemnly sang the village choir  On that sweet Sabbath morn.Through the closed blinds the golden sun  Poured in a dusty beam,Like the celestial ladder seen  By Jacob in his dream.And ever and anon, the wind,  Sweet-scented with the hay,Turned o'er the hymn-book's fluttering leaves That on the window lay.Long was the good man's sermon,  Yet it seemed not so to me;For he spake of Ruth the beautiful,  And still I thought of thee.Long was the prayer he uttered,  Yet it seemed not so to me;For in my heart I prayed with him,  And still I thought of thee.But now, alas! the place seems changed;  Thou art no longer here:Part of the sunshine of the scene  With thee did disappear.Though thoughts, deep-rooted in my heart,  Like pine-trees dark and high,Subdue the light of noon, and breathe  A low and ceaseless sigh;This memory brightens o'er the past,  As when the sun, concealedBehind some cloud that near us hangs  Shines on a distant field. 
                        

                        Just past dawn, the sun standswith its heavy red headin a black stanchion of trees,waiting for someone to comewith his bucketfor the foamy white light,and then a long day in the pasture.I too spend my days grazing,feasting on every green momenttill darkness calls,and with the othersI walk away into the night,swinging the little tin bellof my name. 
                        

                        Do you remember an Inn,Miranda?Do you remember an Inn?And the tedding and the spreadingOf the straw for a bedding,And the fleas that tease in the High Pyrenees,And the wine that tasted of tar?And the cheers and the jeers of the young muleteers(Under the vine of the dark veranda)?Do you remember an Inn, Miranda,Do you remember an Inn?And the cheers and the jeers of the young muleteersWho hadn't got a penny,And who weren't paying any,And the hammer at the doors and the din?And the hip! hop! hap!Of the clapOf the hands to the swirl and the twirlOf the girl gone chancing,Glancing,Dancing,Backing and advancing,Snapping of the clapper to the spinOut and in--And the ting, tong, tang of the guitar!Do you remember an Inn,Miranda?Do you remember an Inn?Never more;Miranda,Never more.Only the high peaks hoar;And Aragon a torrent at the door.No soundIn the walls of the halls where fallsThe treadOf the feet of the dead to the ground,No sound:But the boomOf the far waterfall like doom.

                        I come from haunts of coot and hern, I make a sudden sally And sparkle out among the fern, To bicker down a valley. By thirty hills I hurry down, Or slip between the ridges, By twenty thorpes, a little town, And half a hundred bridges. Till last by Philip's farm I flow To join the brimming river, For men may come and men may go, But I go on for ever. I chatter over stony ways, In little sharps and trebles, I bubble into eddying bays, I babble on the pebbles. With many a curve my banks I fret By many a field and fallow, And many a fairy foreland set With willow-weed and mallow. I chatter, chatter, as I flow To join the brimming river, For men may come and men may go, But I go on for ever. I wind about, and in and out, With here a blossom sailing, And here and there a lusty trout, And here and there a grayling, And here and there a foamy flake Upon me, as I travel With many a silvery waterbreak Above the golden gravel, And draw them all along, and flow To join the brimming river For men may come and men may go, But I go on for ever. I steal by lawns and grassy plots, I slide by hazel covers; I move the sweet forget-me-nots That grow for happy lovers. I slip, I slide, I gloom, I glance, Among my skimming swallows; I make the netted sunbeam dance Against my sandy shallows. I murmur under moon and stars In brambly wildernesses; I linger by my shingly bars; I loiter round my cresses; And out again I curve and flow To join the brimming river, For men may come and men may go, But I go on for ever. 
                        

                        Good-night? ah! no; the hour is illWhich severs those it should unite;Let us remain together still,Then it will be good night.How can I call the lone night good,Though thy sweet wishes wing its flight?Be it not said, thought, understood --Then it will be -- good night.To hearts which near each other moveFrom evening close to morning light,The night is good; because, my love,They never say good-night. 
                        

                        There is a place where the sidewalk endsand before the street begins,and there the grass grows soft and white,and there the sun burns crimson bright,and there the moon-bird rests from his flightto cool in the peppermint wind.Let us leave this place where the smoke blows blackand the dark street winds and bends.Past the pits where the asphalt flowers growwe shall walk with a walk that is measured and slowand watch where the chalk-white arrows goto the place where the sidewalk ends.Yes we'll walk with a walk that is measured and slow,and we'll go where the chalk-white arrows go,for the children, they mark, and the children, they know,the place where the sidewalk ends. 
                        

                        All nature has a feeling: woods, fields, brooksAre life eternal: and in silence theySpeak happiness beyond the reach of books;There's nothing mortal in them; their decayIs the green life of change; to pass awayAnd come again in blooms revivified.Its birth was heaven, eternal it its stay,And with the sun and moon shall still abideBeneath their day and night and heaven wide. 
                        

                        Anyone here had a go at themselvesfor a laugh? Anyone opened their wristswith a blade in the bath? Those in the darkat the back, listen hard. Those at the frontin the know, those of us who have, hands up,let's show that inch of lacerated skinbetween the forearm and the fist. Let's tell itlike it is: strong drink, a crimson tidemarkround the tub, a yard of lint, white towelswashed a dozen times, still pink. Tough luck.A passion then for watches, bangles, cuffs.A likely story: you were lashed by bramblespicking berries from the woods. Come clean, come good,repeat with me the punch line 'Just like blood'when those at the back rush forward to sayhow a little love goes a long long long way. 
                        

                        My eyes already touch the sunny hill.going far ahead of the road I have begun.So we are grasped by what we cannot grasp;it has inner light, even from a distance-and charges us, even if we do not reach it,into something else, which, hardly sensing it,we already are; a gesture waves us onanswering our own wave...but what we feel is the wind in our faces.Translated by Robert Bly 
                        

                        I said to Love, "It is not now as in old days When men adored thee and thy ways    All else above; Named thee the Boy, the Bright, the One Who spread a heaven beneath the sun,"    I said to Love.    I said to him, "We now know more of thee than then; We were but weak in judgment when,    With hearts abrim, We clamoured thee that thou would'st please Inflict on us thine agonies,"    I said to him.    I said to Love, "Thou art not young, thou art not fair, No faery darts, no cherub air,    Nor swan, nor dove Are thine; but features pitiless, And iron daggers of distress,"    I said to Love.    "Depart then, Love! . . . - Man's race shall end, dost threaten thou? The age to come the man of now    Know nothing of? - We fear not such a threat from thee; We are too old in apathy! Mankind shall cease.--So let it be,"    I said to Love. 
                        

                        When these graven lines you see, Traveller, do not pity me; Though I be among the dead, Let no mournful word be said.Children that I leave behind, And their children, all were kind; Near to them and to my wife, I was happy all my life.My three sons I married right, And their sons I rocked at night; Death nor sorrow never brought Cause for one unhappy thought.Now, and with no need of tears, Here they leave me, full of years,-- Leave me to my quiet rest In the region of the blest. 
                        

                        XIVIf thou must love me, let it be for noughtExcept for love's sake only. Do not say'I love her for her smile—her look—her wayOf speaking gently,—for a trick of thoughtThat falls in well with mine, and certes broughtA sense of pleasant ease on such a day'—For these things in themselves, Beloved, mayBe changed, or change for thee,—and love, so wrought,May be unwrought so. Neither love me forThine own dear pity's wiping my cheeks dry,—A creature might forget to weep, who boreThy comfort long, and lose thy love thereby!But love me for love's sake, that evermoreThou mayst love on, through love's eternity.

                        What lips my lips have kissed, and where, and why, I have forgotten, and what arms have lain Under my head till morning; but the rain Is full of ghosts tonight, that tap and sigh Upon the glass and listen for reply, And in my heart there stirs a quiet pain For unremembered lads that not again Will turn to me at midnight with a cry. Thus in winter stands the lonely tree, Nor knows what birds have vanished one by one, Yet knows its boughs more silent than before: I cannot say what loves have come and gone, I only know that summer sang in me A little while, that in me sings no more.

                        And a youth said, "Speak to us of Friendship." Your friend is your needs answered. He is your field which you sow with love and reap with thanksgiving. And he is your board and your fireside. For you come to him with your hunger, and you seek him for peace. When your friend speaks his mind you fear not the "nay" in your own mind, nor do you withhold the "ay." And when he is silent your heart ceases not to listen to his heart; For without words, in friendship, all thoughts, all desires, all expectations are born and shared, with joy that is unacclaimed. When you part from your friend, you grieve not; For that which you love most in him may be clearer in his absence, as the mountain to the climber is clearer from the plain. And let there be no purpose in friendship save the deepening of the spirit. For love that seeks aught but the disclosure of its own mystery is not love but a net cast forth: and only the unprofitable is caught. And let your best be for your friend. If he must know the ebb of your tide, let him know its flood also. For what is your friend that you should seek him with hours to kill? Seek him always with hours to live. For it is his to fill your need, but not your emptiness. And in the sweetness of friendship let there be laughter, and sharing of pleasures. For in the dew of little things the heart finds its morning and is refreshed. 
                        

                        Love and lust are poles apart.  Lust is chaos, love is art.Love infinite, lust is finite.Love is sustained, lust is short.Love is spiritual, lust is physical.Love is ideal, lust is sensual.Love is selfless, lust is selfishLove immortal, lust is mortal. Love is productive, lust is destructive.Love is optional, lust is impulsive.Love is energetic, lust is crazy.Love is humanist, lust instinctive.Lust is rabid dog, love is padagog.Love demands inner beauty, lust demands appearance.Lust starts from black holes of eyes, love from conscientious part of heart.Love develops in brain, lust develops in gonads.Lust stays on surface of the words, but love in depths of unconscious.Love is rationally emotional, lust is emotionally rational. Love is Allopath, lust is Psychopath. Love is Homoeopath, lust is Sociopath. Love kisses, lust disses.Love honours, lust ravishes.Love insight, lust is blind.Lust devours, Love nourishes.Love replays, lust betrays.Love impresses, lust oppresses. Love centralizes, lust strays.Love expresses, lust depresses. Love is healthy, lust is lame. Lust is gambling, love is game. Love is Platonic, lust is Bubonic. Lust is shameless, love is shame. Lust is volcano, love is rain.Love is Abel, lust is Cain.Prophets weep, Demons laugh.Love is fruitful, lust is vain.Love is need, lust is greed. Lust is maniac, love is sane.Lust is a beast, love is dove.Lust is hatred, love is loveLust is passion, love compassion.Lust is beneath, love above.Love is even climb, it is never lost. Lust is a decline, it is ever lost.Love is always true to the core but lust is hyperbole.Love provides endless satisfaction, lust ends at opposite pole.Love is the base of this universe, Lust is baseless in itself.My subject is my subject. Such enveloping my subject. Such as God to His universe. Such as Devil to this universe. Love is a sincerity and responsibility. Lust is insincerity, irresponsibility. Confirmation test is just, sacrifice or obedience. Both or only one is must. Lust is aimless without love.Love is aimful without lust.My subject is thy subject. My subject is love and lust. I can tell you one secret. Love and lust are poles apart. But make union only when. Lust is second, love is first.Just, ask a victim of lust. 
                        

                        A dream lies dead here. May you softly go Before this place, and turn away your eyes, Nor seek to know the look of that which dies Importuning Life for life. Walk not in woe, But, for a little, let your step be slow. And, of your mercy, be not sweetly wise With words of hope and Spring and tenderer skies. A dream lies dead; and this all mourners know: Whenever one drifted petal leaves the tree- Though white of bloom as it had been before And proudly waitful of fecundity- One little loveliness can be no more; And so must Beauty bow her imperfect head Because a dream has joined the wistful dead! 
                        

                        Star, that gives a gracious dole,  What am I to choose?Oh, will it be a shriven soul,  Or little buckled shoes?Shall I wish a wedding-ring,  Bright and thin and round,Or plead you send me covering-  A newly spaded mound?Gentle beam, shall I implore  Gold, or sailing-ships,Or beg I hate forevermore  A pair of lying lips?Swing you low or high away,  Burn you hot or dim;My only wish I dare not say-  Lest you should grant me him. 
                        

                        You have to be always drunk. That's all there is to it--it's the only way. So as not to feel the horrible burden of time that breaks your back and bends you to the earth, you have to be continually drunk. But on what?Wine, poetry or virtue, as you wish. But be drunk. And if sometimes, on the steps of a palace or the green grass of a ditch, in the mournful solitude of your room, you wake again, drunkenness already diminishing or gone, ask the wind, the wave, the star, the bird, the clock, everything that is flying, everything that is groaning, everything that is rolling, everything that is singing, everything that is speaking. . .ask what time it is and wind, wave, star, bird, clock will answer you:"It is time to be drunk! So as not to be the martyred slaves of time, be drunk, becontinually drunk! On wine, on poetry or on virtue as you wish." 
                        

                        On Raglan Road on an autumn day I met her first and knew That her dark hair would weave a snare that I might one day rue; I saw the danger, yet I walked along the enchanted way, And I said, let grief be a fallen leaf at the dawning of the day. On Grafton Street in November we tripped lightly along the ledge Of the deep ravine where can be seen the worth of passion's pledge, The Queen of Hearts still making tarts and I not making hay - O I loved too much and by such and such is happiness thrown away. I gave her gifts of the mind I gave her the secret sign that's known To the artists who have known the true gods of sound and stone And word and tint. I did not stint for I gave her poems to say. With her own name there and her own dark hair like clouds over fields of May On a quiet street where old ghosts meet I see her walking now Away from me so hurriedly my reason must allow That I had wooed not as I should a creature made of clay - When the angel woos the clay he'd lose his wings at the dawn of day. 
                        

                        I Remember, I RememberI remember, I remember The house where I was born, The little window where the sun Came peeping in at morn; He never came a wink too soon Nor brought too long a day; But now, I often wish the night Had borne my breath away.I remember, I remember The roses red and white, The violets and the lily cups-- Those flowers made of light! The lilacs where the robin built, And where my brother set The laburnum on his birthday,-- The tree is living yet!I remember, I remember Where I was used to swing, And thought the air must rush as fresh To swallows on the wing; My spirit flew in feathers then That is so heavy now, The summer pools could hardly cool The fever on my brow.I remember, I remember The fir-trees dark and high; I used to think their slender tops Were close against the sky: It was a childish ignorance, But now 'tis little joy To know I'm farther off from Heaven Than when I was a boy. 
                        

                        You're in this dream of cotton plants.You raise a hoe, swing, and the first weedsFall with a sigh. You take another step,Chop, and the sigh comes again,Until you yourself are breathing that wayWith each step, a sigh that will follow you into town.That's hours later. The sun is a red blisterComing up in your palm. Your back is strong,Young, not yet the broken chairIn an abandoned school of dry spiders. Dust settles on your forehead, dirtSmiles under each fingernail.You chop, step, and by the end of the first row,You can buy one splendid fish for wifeAnd three sons. Another row, another fish,Until you have enough and move on to milk,Bread, meat. Ten hours and the cupboards creak.You can rest in the back yard under a tree.Your hands twitch on your lap,Not unlike the fish on a pier or the bottomOf a boat. You drink iced tea. The minutes jerkLike flies. 			It's dusk, now night,And the lights in your home are on.That costs money, yellow lightIn the kitchen. That's thirty steps,You say to your hands,Now shaped into binoculars.You could raise them to your eyes:You were a fool in school, now look at you.You're a giant among cotton plants.Now you see your oldest boy, also running.Papa, he says, it's time to come in.You pull him into your lapAnd ask, What's forty times nine?He knows as well as you, and you smile.The wind makes peace with the trees,The stars strike themselves in the dark.You get up and walk with the sigh of cotton plants.You go to sleep with a red sun on your palm,The sore light you see when you first stir in bed.

What for? While we yawnSitting at easeIn our climes They leave their homes And reside in camps Strive for a living Internally displaced and dead Beg for a dropp of water And a piece of bread!

                        All the birds have flown up and gone; A lonely cloud floats leisurely by.We never tire of looking at each other -Only the mountain and I. 
                        

                        He thought he saw an ElephantThat practised on a fife:He looked again, and found it wasA letter from his wife.'At length I realize,' he said,'The bitterness of life! 'He thought he saw a BuffaloUpon the chimney-piece:He looked again, and found it wasHis Sister's Husband's Niece.'Unless you leave this house,' he said,'I'll send for the police! 'he thought he saw a RattlesnakeThat questioned him in Greek:He looked again, and found it wasThe Middle of Next Week.'The one thing I regret,' he said,'Is that it cannot speak! 'He thought he saw a Banker's ClerkDescending from the bus:He looked again, and found it wasA Hippopotamus.'If this should stay to dine,' he said,'There won't be much for us! 'He thought he saw a KangarooThat worked a Coffee-mill:He looked again, and found it wasA Vegetable-Pill.'Were I to swallow this,' he said,'I should be very ill!

                        I have eatenthe plumsthat were inthe icebox and whichyou were probablysavingfor breakfast Forgive methey were deliciousso sweetand so cold 
                        

                        She walks in Beauty, like the nightOf cloudless climes and starry skies;And all that's best of dark and brightMeet in her aspect and her eyes:Thus mellowed to that tender lightWhich Heaven to gaudy day denies.One shade the more, one ray the less,Had half impaired the nameless graceWhich waves in every raven tress,Or softly lightens o'er her face;Where thoughts serenely sweet express,How pure, how dear their dwelling-place.And on that cheek, and o'er that brow,So soft, so calm, yet eloquent,The smiles that win, the tints that glow,But tell of days in goodness spent,A mind at peace with all below,A heart whose love is innocent! 
                        

                        We think forever for salvation, We cannot live in separation.Father is great solves situation, Continuous is human migration.While we come we see garden, Man becomes here its warden.We cannot escape from work, We have to walk in row of murk.Life has its own meaning here, We have to live in time in cheer.Fear we do not we think again, In joy and grief we do remain.Pain we wash with water nice, Here we read book we see thrice.Ice melts by getting sun rays sure, By his wisdom we become pure.Nature is such beautiful narration, Life has a meaning and celebration.Glory of father we sing in adoration, Father of heaven gives love vibration. 
                        

                        The sun has burst the skyBecause I love youAnd the river its banks.The sea laps the great rocksBecause I love youAnd takes no heed of the moon dragging it awayAnd saying coldly 'Constancy is not for you'.The blackbird fills the airBecause I love youWith spring and lawns and shadows falling on lawns.The people walk in the street and laughI love youAnd far down the river ships sound their hootersCrazy with joy because I love you. 
                        

                        The tree has entered my hands,The sap has ascended my arms,The tree has grown in my breast -Downward,The branches grow out of me, like arms.Tree you are,Moss you are,You are violets with wind above them.A child - so high - you are,And all this is folly to the world. 
                        

                        All Things will DieClearly the blue river chimes in its flowing     Under my eye;Warmly and broadly the south winds are blowing     Over the sky.One after another the white clouds are fleeting;Every heart this May morning in joyance is beating     Full merrily;  Yet all things must die.The stream will cease to flow;The wind will cease to blow;The clouds will cease to fleet;The heart will cease to beat;  For all things must die.     All things must die.Spring will come never more.     O, vanity!Death waits at the door.See! our friends are all forsakingThe wine and the merrymaking.We are call’d–we must go.Laid low, very low,In the dark we must lie.The merry glees are still;The voice of the birdShall no more be heard,Nor the wind on the hill.     O, misery!Hark! death is callingWhile I speak to ye,The jaw is falling,The red cheek paling,The strong limbs failing;Ice with the warm blood mixing;The eyeballs fixing.Nine times goes the passing bell:Ye merry souls, farewell.     The old earth     Had a birth,     As all men know,     Long ago.And the old earth must die.So let the warm winds range,And the blue wave beat the shore;For even and mornYe will never seeThro’ eternity.All things were born.Ye will come never more,For all things must die. 
                        

                        Down behind the dustbinI met a dog called Ted.‘Leave me alone,’ he says,‘I’m just going to bed.’Down behind the dustbinI met a dog called Roger.‘Do you own this bin?’ I said.‘No. I’m only a lodger.’Down behind the dustbinI met a dog called Sue.‘What are you doing here?’ I said.‘I’ve got nothing else to do.’

                        I do not think of you lying in the wet clayOf a Monaghan graveyard; I seeYou walking down a lane among the poplarsOn your way to the station, or happilyGoing to second Mass on a summer Sunday -You meet me and you say:'Don't forget to see about the cattle - 'Among your earthiest words the angels stray.And I think of you walking along a headlandOf green oats in June,So full of repose, so rich with life -And I see us meeting at the end of a townOn a fair day by accident, afterThe bargains are all made and we can walkTogether through the shops and stalls and marketsFree in the oriental streets of thought.O you are not lying in the wet clay,For it is a harvest evening now and weAre piling up the ricks against the moonlightAnd you smile up at us - eternally. 
                        

                        In my dream, drilling into the marrow of my entire bone, my real dream, I'm walking up and down Beacon Hill searching for a street sign - namely MERCY STREET. Not there. I try the Back Bay. Not there. Not there. And yet I know the number. 45 Mercy Street. I know the stained-glass window of the foyer, the three flights of the house with its parquet floors. I know the furniture and mother, grandmother, great-grandmother, the servants. I know the cupboard of Spode the boat of ice, solid silver, where the butter sits in neat squares like strange giant's teeth on the big mahogany table. I know it well. Not there. Where did you go? 45 Mercy Street, with great-grandmother kneeling in her whale-bone corset and praying gently but fiercely to the wash basin, at five A.M. at noon dozing in her wiggy rocker, grandfather taking a nap in the pantry, grandmother pushing the bell for the downstairs maid, and Nana rocking Mother with an oversized flower on her forehead to cover the curl of when she was good and when she was... And where she was begat and in a generation the third she will beget, me, with the stranger's seed blooming into the flower called Horrid. I walk in a yellow dress and a white pocketbook stuffed with cigarettes, enough pills, my wallet, my keys, and being twenty-eight, or is it forty-five? I walk. I walk. I hold matches at street signs for it is dark, as dark as the leathery dead and I have lost my green Ford, my house in the suburbs, two little kids sucked up like pollen by the bee in me and a husband who has wiped off his eyes in order not to see my inside out and I am walking and looking and this is no dream just my oily life where the people are alibis and the street is unfindable for an entire lifetime. Pull the shades down - I don't care! Bolt the door, mercy, erase the number, rip down the street sign, what can it matter, what can it matter to this cheapskate who wants to own the past that went out on a dead ship and left me only with paper? Not there. I open my pocketbook, as women do, and fish swim back and forth between the dollars and the lipstick. I pick them out, one by one and throw them at the street signs, and shoot my pocketbook into the Charles River. Next I pull the dream off and slam into the cement wall of the clumsy calendar I live in, my life, and its hauled up notebooks. 
                        

                        Between us now and here -    Two thrown together Who are not wont to wear    Life's flushest feather - Who see the scenes slide past, The daytimes dimming fast, Let there be truth at last,    Even if despair. So thoroughly and long    Have you now known me, So real in faith and strong    Have I now shown me, That nothing needs disguise Further in any wise, Or asks or justifies    A guarded tongue. Face unto face, then, say,    Eyes mine own meeting, Is your heart far away,    Or with mine beating? When false things are brought low, And swift things have grown slow, Feigning like froth shall go,    Faith be for aye. 
                        

                        We will be what we could be. Do not say, "It might have been, had not this, or that, or this." No fate can keep us from the chosen way; He only might who is. We will do what we could do. Do not dream Chance leaves a hero, all uncrowned to grieve. I hold, all men are greatly what they seem; He does, who could achieve. We will climb where we could climb. Tell me not Of adverse storms that kept thee from the height. What eagle ever missed the peak he sought? He always climbs who might. I do not like the phrase "It might have been!" It lacks force, and life's best truths perverts: For I believe we have, and reach, and win, Whatever our deserts. 
                        

                        Once there was a tree....and she loved a little boy.And everyday the boy would comeand he would gather her leavesand make them into crownsand play king of the forest.He would climb up her trunkand swing from her branchesand eat apples.And they would play hide-and-go-seek.And when he was tired,he would sleep in her shade.And the boy loved the tree....very much.And the tree was happy.But time went by.And the boy grew older.And the tree was often alone.Then one day the boy came to the treeand the tree said, 'Come, Boy, come andclimb up my trunk and swing from my branches and eat apples and play in myshade and be happy.''I am too big to climb and play' saidthe boy.'I want to buy things and have fun.I want some money?''I'm sorry,' said the tree, 'but Ihave no money.I have only leaves and apples.Take my apples, Boy, and sell them in the city. Then you will have money andyou will be happy.'And so the boy climbed up thetree and gathered her applesand carried them away.And the tree was happy.But the boy stayed away for a long time....and the tree was sad.And then one day the boy came backand the tree shook with joyand she said, 'Come, Boy, climb up my trunkand swing from my branches and be happy.''I am too busy to climb trees,' said the boy.'I want a house to keep me warm,' he said.'I want a wife and I want children,and so I need a house.Can you give me a house ?' ' I have no house,' said the tree.'The forest is my house,but you may cut off my branches and build a house. Then you will be happy.'And so the boy cut off her branchesand carried them awayto build his house.And the tree was happy.But the boy stayed away for a long time.And when he came back,the tree was so happyshe could hardly speak.'Come, Boy,' she whispered,'come and play.''I am too old and sad to play,'said the boy.'I want a boat that will take me far away from here.Can you give me a boat?''Cut down my trunkand make a boat,' said the tree.'Then you can sail away...and be happy.'And so the boy cut down her trunkand made a boat and sailed away.And the tree was happy... but not really.And after a long timethe boy came back again.'I am sorry, Boy,'said the tree,' but I have nothingleft to give you -My apples are gone.''My teeth are too weakfor apples,' said the boy.'My branches are gone,'said the tree. ' Youcannot swing on them - ''I am too old to swingon branches,' said the boy.'My trunk is gone, ' said the tree.'You cannot climb - ''I am too tired to climb' said the boy.'I am sorry,' sighed the tree.'I wish that I could give you something....but I have nothing left. I am just an old stump.I am sorry....''I don't need very much now,' said the boy.'just a quiet place to sit and rest.I am very tired.''Well,' said the tree, straighteningherself up as much as she could,'well, an old stump is good for sitting and restingCome, Boy, sit down. Sit down and rest.'And the boy did. And the tree was happy. 
                        

                        As virtuous men pass mildly away,     And whisper to their souls, to go,Whilst some of their sad friends do say,     'The breath goes now,' and some say, 'No:'So let us melt, and make no noise,    No tear-floods, nor sigh-tempests move;'Twere profanation of our joys    To tell the laity our love.Moving of th' earth brings harms and fears;    Men reckon what it did, and meant;But trepidation of the spheres,    Though greater far, is innocent.Dull sublunary lovers' love    (Whose soul is sense) cannot admitAbsence, because it doth remove    Those things which elemented it.But we by a love so much refin'd,    That ourselves know not what it is,Inter-assured of the mind,    Care less, eyes, lips, and hands to miss.Our two souls therefore, which are one,    Though I must go, endure not yetA breach, but an expansion,    Like gold to airy thinness beat.If they be two, they are two so    As stiff twin compasses are two;Thy soul, the fix'd foot, makes no show    To move, but doth, if the' other do.And though it in the centre sit,    Yet when the other far doth roam,It leans, and hearkens after it,    And grows erect, as that comes home.Such wilt thou be to me, who must    Like th' other foot, obliquely run;Thy firmness makes my circle just,    And makes me end, where I begun. 
                        

                        I shot an arrow into the air,It fell to earth, I knew not where; For, so swiftly it flew, the sightCould not follow it in its flight.I breathed a song into the air,It fell to earth, I knew not where; For who has sight so keen and strong,That it can follow the flight of song? Long, long afterward, in an oakI found the arrow, still unbroke; And the song, from beginning to end,I found again in the heart of a friend. 
                        

                        <i>Translated into English in 1859 by Edward FitzGerald</i>I.Awake! for Morning in the Bowl of NightHas flung the Stone that puts the Stars to Flight:And Lo! the Hunter of the East has caughtThe Sultan's Turret in a Noose of Light. II.Dreaming when Dawn's Left Hand was in the SkyI heard a voice within the Tavern cry,'Awake, my Little ones, and fill the CupBefore Life's Liquor in its Cup be dry.' III.And, as the Cock crew, those who stood beforeThe Tavern shouted -  'Open then the Door! You know how little while we have to stay,And, once departed, may return no more.' IV.Now the New Year reviving old Desires,The thoughtful Soul to Solitude retires,Where the White Hand of Moses on the BoughPuts out, and Jesus from the Ground suspires. V.Iram indeed is gone with all its Rose,And Jamshyd's Sev'n-ring'd Cup where no one Knows; But still the Vine her ancient ruby yields,And still a Garden by the Water blows. VI.And David's Lips are lock't; but in divineHigh piping Pehlevi, with 'Wine! Wine! Wine! Red Wine! ' -  the Nightingale cries to the RoseThat yellow Cheek of hers to incarnadine. VII.Come, fill the Cup, and in the Fire of SpringThe Winter Garment of Repentance fling:The Bird of Time has but a little wayTo fly -  and Lo! the Bird is on the Wing. VIII.Whether at Naishapur or Babylon,Whether the Cup with sweet or bitter run,The Wine of Life keeps oozing drop by drop,The Leaves of Life kep falling one by one. IX.Morning a thousand Roses brings, you say; Yes, but where leaves the Rose of Yesterday? And this first Summer month that brings the RoseShall take Jamshyd and Kaikobad away. X.But come with old Khayyam, and leave the LotOf Kaikobad and Kaikhosru forgot:Let Rustum lay about him as he will,Or Hatim Tai cry Supper -  heed them not. XI.With me along the strip of Herbage strownThat just divides the desert from the sown,Where name of Slave and Sultan is forgot - And Peace is Mahmud on his Golden Throne! XII.A Book of Verses underneath the Bough,A Jug of Wine, a Loaf of Bread, -  and ThouBeside me singing in the Wilderness - Oh, Wilderness were Paradise now! XIII.Some for the Glories of This World; and someSigh for the Prophet's Paradise to come; Ah, take the Cash, and let the Promise go,Nor heed the rumble of a distant Drum! XIV.Were it not Folly, Spider-like to spinThe Thread of present Life away to win - What? for ourselves, who know not if we shallBreathe out the very Breath we now breathe in! XV.Look to the Rose that blows about us -  'Lo,Laughing,' she says, 'into the World I blow:At once the silken Tassel of my PurseTear, and its Treasure on the Garden throw.' XVI.The Worldly Hope men set their Hearts uponTurns Ashes -  or it prospers; and anon,Like Snow upon the Desert's dusty FaceLighting a little Hour or two -  is gone. XVII.And those who husbanded the Golden Grain,And those who flung it to the Winds like Rain,Alike to no such aureate Earth are turn'dAs, buried once, Men want dug up again. XVIII.Think, in this batter'd CaravanseraiWhose Doorways are alternate Night and Day,How Sultan after Sultan with his PompAbode his Hour or two and went his way. XIX.They say the Lion and the Lizard keepThe Courts where Jamshyd gloried and drank deep:And Bahram, that great Hunter -  the Wild AssStamps o'er his Head, but cannot break his Sleep. XX.I sometimes think that never blows so redThe Rose as where some buried Caesar bled; That every Hyacinth the Garden wearsDropt in its Lap from some once lovely Head. XXI.And this delightful Herb whose tender GreenFledges the River's Lip on which we lean - Ah, lean upon it lightly! for who knowsFrom what once lovely Lip it springs unseen! XXII.Ah, my Beloved, fill the Cup that clearsTo-day of past Regrets and future Fears - To-morrow? -  Why, To-morrow I may beMyself with Yesterday's Sev'n Thousand Years. XXIII.Lo! some we loved, the loveliest and bestThat Time and Fate of all their Vintage prest,Have drunk their Cup a Round or two before,And one by one crept silently to Rest. XXIV.And we, that now make merry in the RoomThey left, and Summer dresses in new Bloom,Ourselves must we beneath the Couch of EarthDescend, ourselves to make a Couch -  for whom? XXV.Ah, make the most of what we may yet spend,Before we too into the Dust descend; Dust into Dust, and under Dust, to lie; Sans Wine, sans Song, sans Singer, and -  sans End! XXVI.Alike for those who for To-day prepare,And those that after some To-morrow stare,A Muezzin from the Tower of Darkness cries'Fools! Your Reward is neither Here nor There! ' XXVII.Why, all the Saints and Sages who discuss'dOf the Two Worlds so learnedly, are thrustLike foolish Prophets forth; their Works to ScornAre scatter'd, and their Mouths are stopt with Dust. XXVIII.Oh, come with old Khayyam, and leave the WiseTo talk; one thing is certain, that Life flies; One thing is certain, and the Rest is Lies; The Flower that once has blown forever dies. XXIX.Myself when young did eagerly frequentDoctor and Saint, and heard great ArgumentAbout it and about; but evermoreCame out by the same Door as in I went. XXX.With them the Seed of Wisdom did I sow,And with my own hand labour'd it to grow:And this was all the Harvest that I reap'd - 'I came like Water and like Wind I go.' XXXI.Into this Universe, and Why not knowing,Nor Whence, like Water willy-nilly flowing:And out of it, as Wind along the Waste,I know not Whither, willy-nilly blowing. XXXII.Up from Earth's Centre through the Seventh GateI rose, and on the Throne of Saturn sate,And many Knots unravel'd by the Road; But not the Master-Knot of Human Fate. XXXIII.There was the Door to which I found no Key:There was the Veil through which I could not see:Some little talk awhile of Me and TheeThere was -  and then no more of Thee and Me. XXXIV.Then to the rolling Heav'n itself I cried,Asking, 'What Lamp had Destiny to guideHer little Children stumbling in the Dark? 'And -  'A blind Understanding! ' Heav'n replied. XXXV.Then to the Lip of this poor earthen UrnI lean'd, the secret Well of Life to learn:And Lip to Lip it murmur'd -  'While you live,Drink! -  for, once dead, you never shall return.' XXXVI.I think the Vessel, that with fugitiveArticulation answer'd, once did live,And merry-make, and the cold Lip I kiss'd,How many Kisses might it take -  and give! XXXVII.For in the Market-place, one Dusk of Day,I watch'd the Potter thumping his wet Clay:And with its all obliterated TongueIt murmur'd -  'Gently, Brother, gently, pray! ' XXXVIII.And has not such a Story from of OldDown Man's successive generations roll'dOf such a clod of saturated EarthCast by the Maker into Human mould? XXXIX.Ah, fill the Cup: -  what boots it to repeatHow Time is slipping underneath our Feet:Unborn To-morrow, and dead Yesterday,Why fret about them if To-day be sweet! XL.A Moment's Halt -  a momentary tasteOf Being from the Well amid the Waste - And Lo! the phantom Caravan has reach'dThe Nothing it set out from -  Oh, make haste! XLI.Oh, plagued no more with Human or Divine,To-morrow's tangle to itself resign,And lose your fingers in the tresses ofThe Cypress-slender Minister of Wine. XLII.Waste not your Hour, nor in the vain pursuitOf This and That endeavor and dispute; Better be merry with the fruitful GrapeThan sadden after none, or bitter, fruit. XLIII.You know, my Friends, with what a brave CarouseI made a Second Marriage in my house; Divorced old barren Reason from my Bed,And took the Daughter of the Vine to Spouse. XLIV.And lately, by the Tavern Door agape,Came stealing through the Dusk an Angel ShapeBearing a Vessel on his Shoulder; andHe bid me taste of it; and 'twas -  the Grape! XLV.The Grape that can with Logic absoluteThe Two-and-Seventy jarring Sects confute:The subtle Alchemest that in a TriceLife's leaden Metal into Gold transmute. XLVI.Why, be this Juice the growth of God, who dareBlaspheme the twisted tendril as Snare? A Blessing, we should use it, should we not? And if a Curse -  why, then, Who set it there? XLVII.But leave the Wise to wrangle, and with meThe Quarrel of the Universe let be:And, in some corner of the Hubbub couch'd,Make Game of that which makes as much of Thee. XLVIII.For in and out, above, about, below,'Tis nothing but a Magic Shadow-show,Play'd in a Box whose Candle is the Sun,Round which we Phantom Figures come and go. XLIX.Strange, is it not? that of the myriads whoBefore us pass'd the door of Darkness throughNot one returns to tell us of the Road,Which to discover we must travel too. L.The Revelations of Devout and Learn'dWho rose before us, and as Prophets burn'd,Are all but Stories, which, awoke from Sleep,They told their fellows, and to Sleep return'd. LI.Why, if the Soul can fling the Dust aside,And naked on the Air of Heaven ride,Is't not a shame -  Is't not a shame for himSo long in this Clay suburb to abide? LII.But that is but a Tent wherein may restA Sultan to the realm of Death addrest; The Sultan rises, and the dark FerrashStrikes, and prepares it for another guest. LIII.I sent my Soul through the Invisible,Some letter of that After-life to spell:And after many days my Soul return'dAnd said, 'Behold, Myself am Heav'n and Hell.' LIV.Heav'n but the Vision of fulfill'd Desire,And Hell the Shadow of a Soul on fire,Cast on the Darkness into which Ourselves,So late emerg'd from, shall so soon expire. LV.While the Rose blows along the River Brink,With old Khayyam and ruby vintage drink:And when the Angel with his darker DraughtDraws up to Thee -  take that, and do not shrink. LVI.And fear not lest Existence closing yourAccount, should lose, or know the type no more; The Eternal Saki from the Bowl has pour'dMillions of Bubbls like us, and will pour. LVII.When You and I behind the Veil are past,Oh but the long long while the World shall last,Which of our Coming and Departure heedsAs much as Ocean of a pebble-cast. LVIII.'Tis all a Chequer-board of Nights and DaysWhere Destiny with Men for Pieces plays:Hither and thither moves, and mates, and slays,And one by one back in the Closet lays. LIX.The Ball no Question makes of Ayes and Noes,But Right or Left, as strikes the Player goes; And he that toss'd Thee down into the Field,He knows about it all -  He knows -  HE knows! LX.The Moving Finger writes; and, having writ,Moves on: nor all thy Piety nor WitShall lure it back to cancel half a Line,Nor all thy Tears wash out a Word of it. LXI.For let Philosopher and Doctor preachOf what they will, and what they will not -  eachIs but one Link in an eternal ChainThat none can slip, nor break, nor over-reach. LXII.And that inverted Bowl we call The Sky,Whereunder crawling coop't we live and die,Lift not thy hands to it for help -  for ItRolls impotently on as Thou or I. LXIII.With Earth's first Clay They did the Last Man knead,And then of the Last Harvest sow'd the Seed:Yea, the first Morning of Creation wroteWhat the Last Dawn of Reckoning shall read. LXIV.Yesterday This Day's Madness did prepare; To-morrow's Silence, Triumph, or Despair:Drink! for you know not whence you came, nor why:Drink! for you know not why you go, nor where. LXV.I tell You this -  When, starting from the Goal,Over the shoulders of the flaming FoalOf Heav'n Parwin and Mushtari they flung,In my predestin'd Plot of Dust and Soul. LXVI.The Vine has struck a fiber: which aboutIf clings my Being -  let the Dervish flout; Of my Base metal may be filed a Key,That shall unlock the Door he howls without. LXVII.And this I know: whether the one True Light,Kindle to Love, or Wrath -  consume me quite,One Glimpse of It within the Tavern caughtBetter than in the Temple lost outright. LXVIII.What! out of senseless Nothing to provokeA conscious Something to resent the yokeOf unpermitted Pleasure, under painOf Everlasting Penalties, if broke! LXIX.What! from his helpless Creature be repaidPure Gold for what he lent us dross-allay'd - Sue for a Debt we never did contract,And cannot answer -  Oh the sorry trade! LXX.Nay, but for terror of his wrathful Face,I swear I will not call Injustice Grace; Not one Good Fellow of the Tavern butWould kick so poor a Coward from the place. LXXI.Oh Thou, who didst with pitfall and with ginBeset the Road I was to wander in,Thou will not with Predestin'd Evil roundEnmesh me, and impute my Fall to Sin? LXXII.Oh, Thou, who Man of baser Earth didst make,And who with Eden didst devise the Snake; For all the Sin wherewith the Face of ManIs blacken'd, Man's Forgiveness give -  and take! LXXIII.Listen again. One Evening at the CloseOf Ramazan, ere the better Moon arose,In that old Potter's Shop I stood aloneWith the clay Population round in Rows. LXXIV.And, strange to tell, among that Earthen LotSome could articulate, while others not:And suddenly one more impatient cried - 'Who is the Potter, pray, and who the Pot? ' LXXV.Then said another -  'Surely not in vainMy Substance from the common Earth was ta'en,That He who subtly wrought me into ShapeShould stamp me back to common Earth again.' LXXVI.Another said -  'Why, ne'er a peevish Boy,Would break the Bowl from which he drank in Joy; Shall He that made the vessel in pure LoveAnd Fancy, in an after Rage destroy? ' LXXVII.None answer'd this; but after Silence spakeA Vessel of a more ungainly Make:'They sneer at me for leaning all awry; What! did the Hand then of the Potter shake? ' LXXVIII:'Why,' said another, 'Some there are who tellOf one who threatens he will toss to HellThe luckless Pots he marred in making -  Pish! He's a Good Fellow, and 'twill all be well.' LXXIX.Then said another with a long-drawn Sigh,'My Clay with long oblivion is gone dry:But, fill me with the old familiar Juice,Methinks I might recover by-and-by! ' LXXX.So while the Vessels one by one were speaking,The Little Moon look'd in that all were seeking:And then they jogg'd each other, 'Brother! Brother! Now for the Porter's shoulder-knot a-creaking! ' LXXXI.Ah, with the Grape my fading Life provide,And wash my Body whence the Life has died,And in a Windingsheet of Vine-leaf wrapt,So bury me by some sweet Garden-side. LXXXII.That ev'n my buried Ashes such a SnareOf Perfume shall fling up into the Air,As not a True Believer passing byBut shall be overtaken unaware. LXXXIII.Indeed the Idols I have loved so longHave done my Credit in Men's Eye much wrong:Have drown'd my Honour in a shallow Cup,And sold my Reputation for a Song. LXXXIV.Indeed, indeed, Repentance oft beforeI swore -  but was I sober when I swore? And then, and then came Spring, and Rose-in-handMy thread-bare Penitence apieces tore. LXXXV.And much as Wine has play'd the Infidel,And robb'd me of my Robe of Honor -  well,I often wonder what the Vintners buyOne half so precious as the Goods they sell. LXXXVI.Alas, that Spring should vanish with the Rose! That Youth's sweet-scented Manuscript should close! The Nightingale that in the Branches sang,Ah, whence, and whither flown again, who knows! LXXXVII.Would but the Desert of the Fountain yieldOne glimpse -  If dimly, yet indeed, reveal'dTo which the fainting Traveller might spring,As springs the trampled herbage of the field! LXXXVIII.Ah Love! could thou and I with Fate conspireTo grasp this sorry Scheme of Things entire,Would not we shatter it to bits -  and thenRe-mould it nearer to the Heart's Desire! LXXXIX.Ah, Moon of my Delight who know'st no wane,The Moon of Heav'n is rising once again:How oft hereafter rising shall she lookThrough this same Garden after me -  in vain! XC.And when like her, oh Saki, you shall passAmong the Guests star-scatter'd on the Grass,And in your joyous errand reach the spotWhere I made one -  turn down an empty Glass!

                        If you don't know the kind of person I amand I don't know the kind of person you area pattern that others made may prevail in the worldand following the wrong god home we may miss our star.For there is many a small betrayal in the mind,a shrug that lets the fragile sequence breaksending with shouts the horrible errors of childhoodstorming out to play through the broken dyke.And as elephants parade holding each elephant's tail,but if one wanders the circus won't find the park,I call it cruel and maybe the root of all crueltyto know what occurs but not recognize the fact.And so I appeal to a voice, to something shadowy,a remote important region in all who talk:though we could fool each other, we should consider--lest the parade of our mutual life get lost in the dark.For it is important that awake people be awake,or a breaking line may discourage them back to sleep;the signals we give--yes or no, or maybe--should be clear: the darkness around us is deep. 
                        

                        Three times I had the lust to kill,To clutch a throat so young and fair,And squeeze with all my might untilNo breath of being lingered there.Three times I drove the demon out,Though on my brow was evil sweat. . . .And yet I know beyond a doubtHe'll get me yet, he'll get me yet.I know I'm mad, I ought to tellThe doctors, let them care for me,Confine me in a padded cellAnd never, never set me free;But Oh how cruel that would be!For I am young - and comely too . . .Yet dim my demon I can see,And there is but one thing to do.Three times I beat the foul fiend back;The fourth, I know he will prevail,And so I'll seek the railway trackAnd lay my head upon the rail,And sight the dark and distant train,And hear its thunder louder roll,Coming to crush my cursed brain . . .Oh God, have mercy on my soul! 
                        

                        Pretty women wonder where my secret lies.I'm not cute or built to suit a fashion model's sizeBut when I start to tell them,They think I'm telling lies.I say,It's in the reach of my armsThe span of my hips,The stride of my step,The curl of my lips.I'm a womanPhenomenally.Phenomenal woman,That's me.I walk into a roomJust as cool as you please,And to a man,The fellows stand orFall down on their knees.Then they swarm around me,A hive of honey bees.I say,It's the fire in my eyes,And the flash of my teeth,The swing in my waist,And the joy in my feet.I'm a womanPhenomenally.Phenomenal woman,That's me.Men themselves have wonderedWhat they see in me.They try so muchBut they can't touchMy inner mystery.When I try to show themThey say they still can't see.I say,It's in the arch of my back,The sun of my smile,The ride of my breasts,The grace of my style.I'm a womanPhenomenally.Phenomenal woman,That's me.Now you understandJust why my head's not bowed.I don't shout or jump aboutOr have to talk real loud.When you see me passingIt ought to make you proud.I say,It's in the click of my heels,The bend of my hair,the palm of my hand,The need of my care,'Cause I'm a womanPhenomenally.Phenomenal woman,That's me. 
                        

                        You may write me down in historyWith your bitter, twisted lies,You may tread me in the very dirtBut still, like dust, I'll rise.Does my sassiness upset you? Why are you beset with gloom? 'Cause I walk like I've got oil wellsPumping in my living room.Just like moons and like suns,With the certainty of tides,Just like hopes springing high,Still I'll rise.Did you want to see me broken? Bowed head and lowered eyes? Shoulders falling down like teardrops.Weakened by my soulful cries.Does my haughtiness offend you? Don't you take it awful hard'Cause I laugh like I've got gold minesDiggin' in my own back yard.You may shoot me with your words,You may cut me with your eyes,You may kill me with your hatefulness,But still, like air, I'll rise.Does my sexiness upset you? Does it come as a surpriseThat I dance like I've got diamondsAt the meeting of my thighs? Out of the huts of history's shameI riseUp from a past that's rooted in painI riseI'm a black ocean, leaping and wide,Welling and swelling I bear in the tide.Leaving behind nights of terror and fearI riseInto a daybreak that's wondrously clearI riseBringing the gifts that my ancestors gave,I am the dream and the hope of the slave.I riseI riseI rise. 
                        

                        Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,And sorry I could not travel bothAnd be one traveler, long I stoodAnd looked down one as far as I couldTo where it bent in the undergrowth; Then took the other, as just as fair,And having perhaps the better claimBecause it was grassy and wanted wear,Though as for that the passing thereHad worn them really about the same,And both that morning equally layIn leaves no step had trodden black.Oh, I kept the first for another day! Yet knowing how way leads on to wayI doubted if I should ever come back.I shall be telling this with a sighSomewhere ages and ages hence:Two roads diverged in a wood, and I,I took the one less traveled by,And that has made all the difference. 
                        

                        I want you to knowone thing. You know how this is: if I look at the crystal moon, at the red branch of the slow autumn at my window, if I touch near the fire the impalpable ash or the wrinkled body of the log, everything carries me to you, as if everything that exists, aromas, light, metals, were little boats that sail toward those isles of yours that wait for me. Well, now, if little by little you stop loving me I shall stop loving you little by little. If suddenly you forget me do not look for me, for I shall already have forgotten you. If you think it long and mad, the wind of banners that passes through my life, and you decide to leave me at the shore of the heart where I have roots, remember that on that day, at that hour, I shall lift my arms and my roots will set off to seek another land. But if each day, each hour, you feel that you are destined for me with implacable sweetness, if each day a flower climbs up to your lips to seek me, ah my love, ah my own, in me all that fire is repeated, in me nothing is extinguished or forgotten, my love feeds on your love, beloved, and as long as you live it will be in your arms without leaving mine. 
                        

                        Hold fast to dreamsFor if dreams dieLife is a broken-winged birdThat cannot fly.Hold fast to dreamsFor when dreams goLife is a barren fieldFrozen with snow. 
                        

                        It was many and many a year ago,          In a kingdom by the sea,    That a maiden there lived whom you may know          By the name of ANNABEL LEE;     And this maiden she lived with no other thought          Than to love and be loved by me.    I was a child and she was a child,          In this kingdom by the sea;     But we loved with a love that was more than love-          I and my Annabel Lee;     With a love that the winged seraphs of heaven          Coveted her and me.    And this was the reason that, long ago,          In this kingdom by the sea,    A wind blew out of a cloud, chilling          My beautiful Annabel Lee;     So that her highborn kinsman came          And bore her away from me,    To shut her up in a sepulchre          In this kingdom by the sea.    The angels, not half so happy in heaven,          Went envying her and me-    Yes! - that was the reason (as all men know,          In this kingdom by the sea)     That the wind came out of the cloud by night,          Chilling and killing my Annabel Lee.    But our love it was stronger by far than the love          Of those who were older than we-          Of many far wiser than we-    And neither the angels in heaven above,          Nor the demons down under the sea,    Can ever dissever my soul from the soul          Of the beautiful Annabel Lee.    For the moon never beams without bringing me dreams          Of the beautiful Annabel Lee;     And the stars never rise but I feel the bright eyes          Of the beautiful Annabel Lee;     And so, all the night-tide, I lie down by the side    Of my darling- my darling- my life and my bride,          In the sepulchre there by the sea,          In her tomb by the sounding sea. 
                        

                        The free bird leapson the back of the windand floats downstreamtill the current endsand dips his wingsin the orange sun raysand dares to claim the sky.But a bird that stalksdown his narrow cagecan seldom see throughhis bars of ragehis wings are clipped andhis feet are tiedso he opens his throat to sing.The caged bird singswith fearful trillof the things unknownbut longed for stilland his tune is heardon the distant hill for the caged birdsings of freedomThe free bird thinks of another breezeand the trade winds soft through the sighing treesand the fat worms waiting on a dawn-bright lawnand he names the sky his own.But a caged bird stands on the grave of dreamshis shadow shouts on a nightmare screamhis wings are clipped and his feet are tiedso he opens his throat to singThe caged bird singswith a fearful trillof things unknownbut longed for stilland his tune is heardon the distant hillfor the caged birdsings of freedom. 
                        

                        Whose woods these are I think I know.His house is in the village, though; He will not see me stopping hereTo watch his woods fill up with snow.My little horse must think it queerTo stop without a farmhouse nearBetween the woods and frozen lakeThe darkest evening of the year.He gives his harness bells a shakeTo ask if there is some mistake.The only other sound's the sweepOf easy wind and downy flake.The woods are lovely, dark and deep,But I have promises to keep,And miles to go before I sleep,And miles to go before I sleep. 
                        

                        The most important thing we've learned,So far as children are concerned,Is never, NEVER, NEVER letThem near your television set --Or better still, just don't installThe idiotic thing at all.In almost every house we've been,We've watched them gaping at the screen.They loll and slop and lounge about,And stare until their eyes pop out.(Last week in someone's place we sawA dozen eyeballs on the floor.)They sit and stare and stare and sitUntil they're hypnotised by it,Until they're absolutely drunkWith all that shocking ghastly junk.Oh yes, we know it keeps them still,They don't climb out the window sill,They never fight or kick or punch,They leave you free to cook the lunchAnd wash the dishes in the sink --But did you ever stop to think,To wonder just exactly whatThis does to your beloved tot?IT ROTS THE SENSE IN THE HEAD!IT KILLS IMAGINATION DEAD!IT CLOGS AND CLUTTERS UP THE MIND!IT MAKES A CHILD SO DULL AND BLINDHE CAN NO LONGER UNDERSTANDA FANTASY, A FAIRYLAND!HIS BRAIN BECOMES AS SOFT AS CHEESE!HIS POWERS OF THINKING RUST AND FREEZE!HE CANNOT THINK -- HE ONLY SEES!'All right!' you'll cry. 'All right!' you'll say,'But if we take the set away,What shall we do to entertainOur darling children? Please explain!'We'll answer this by asking you,'What used the darling ones to do?'How used they keep themselves contentedBefore this monster was invented?'Have you forgotten? Don't you know?We'll say it very loud and slow:THEY ... USED ... TO ... READ! They'd READ and READ,AND READ and READ, and then proceedTo READ some more. Great Scott! Gadzooks!One half their lives was reading books!The nursery shelves held books galore!Books cluttered up the nursery floor!And in the bedroom, by the bed,More books were waiting to be read!Such wondrous, fine, fantastic talesOf dragons, gypsies, queens, and whalesAnd treasure isles, and distant shoresWhere smugglers rowed with muffled oars,And pirates wearing purple pants,And sailing ships and elephants,And cannibals crouching 'round the pot,Stirring away at something hot.(It smells so good, what can it be?Good gracious, it's Penelope.)The younger ones had Beatrix PotterWith Mr. Tod, the dirty rotter,And Squirrel Nutkin, Pigling Bland,And Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle and-Just How The Camel Got His Hump,And How the Monkey Lost His Rump,And Mr. Toad, and bless my soul,There's Mr. Rat and Mr. Mole-Oh, books, what books they used to know,Those children living long ago!So please, oh please, we beg, we pray,Go throw your TV set away,And in its place you can installA lovely bookshelf on the wall.Then fill the shelves with lots of books,Ignoring all the dirty looks,The screams and yells, the bites and kicks,And children hitting you with sticks-Fear not, because we promise youThat, in about a week or twoOf having nothing else to do,They'll now begin to feel the needOf having something to read.And once they start -- oh boy, oh boy!You watch the slowly growing joyThat fills their hearts. They'll grow so keenThey'll wonder what they'd ever seenIn that ridiculous machine,That nauseating, foul, unclean,Repulsive television screen!And later, each and every kidWill love you more for what you did. 
                        

                        If you can keep your head when all about you  Are losing theirs and blaming it on you; If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,  But make allowance for their doubting too:If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,  Or, being lied about, don't deal in lies,Or being hated don't give way to hating,  And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise;  If you can dream- -and not make dreams your master;   If you can think- -and not make thoughts your aim,If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster  And treat those two impostors just the same:.If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken  Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,  And stoop and build'em up with worn-out tools;  If you can make one heap of all your winnings  And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,And lose, and start again at your beginnings,  And never breathe a word about your loss:If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew  To serve your turn long after they are gone,And so hold on when there is nothing in you  Except the Will which says to them: 'Hold on! ' If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,  Or walk with Kings- -nor lose the common touch,If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,  If all men count with you, but none too much:If you can fill the unforgiving minute  With sixty seconds' worth of distance run,Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it,  And- -which is more- -you'll be a Man, my son! 
                        

                        Do not stand at my grave and weep  I am not there. I do not sleep.  I am a thousand winds that blow.  I am the diamond glints on snow.  I am the sunlight on ripened grain.  I am the gentle autumn rain.  When you awaken in the morning's hush  I am the swift uplifting rush  Of quiet birds in circled flight.  I am the soft stars that shine at night.  Do not stand at my grave and cry;  I am not there. I did not die. 
                        

                        I do not love you except because I love you; I go from loving to not loving you,From waiting to not waiting for youMy heart moves from cold to fire.I love you only because it's you the one I love; I hate you deeply, and hating youBend to you, and the measure of my changing love for youIs that I do not see you but love you blindly.Maybe January light will consumeMy heart with its cruelRay, stealing my key to true calm.In this part of the story I am the one whoDies, the only one, and I will die of love because I love you,Because I love you, Love, in fire and blood. 
                        

                        Some say the world will end in fire,Some say in ice.From what I've tasted of desireI hold with those who favor fire.But if it had to perish twice,I think I know enough of hateTo say that for destruction iceIs also greatAnd would suffice. 
                        

                        It was a long time ago.I have almost forgotten my dream.But it was there then,In front of me,Bright like a sun—My dream.And then the wall rose,Rose slowly,Slowly,Between me and my dream.Rose until it touched the sky—The wall.Shadow.I am black.I lie down in the shadow.No longer the light of my dream before me,Above me.Only the thick wall.Only the shadow.My hands! My dark hands! Break through the wall! Find my dream! Help me to shatter this darkness,To smash this night,To break this shadowInto a thousand lights of sun,Into a thousand whirling dreamsOf sun! 
                        

                        Take this kiss upon the brow!           And, in parting from you now,          Thus much let me avow-          You are not wrong, who deem          That my days have been a dream;           Yet if hope has flown away          In a night, or in a day,          In a vision, or in none,          Is it therefore the less gone?           All that we see or seem          Is but a dream within a dream.          I stand amid the roar          Of a surf-tormented shore,          And I hold within my hand          Grains of the golden sand-          How few! yet how they creep          Through my fingers to the deep,          While I weep- while I weep!           O God! can I not grasp          Them with a tighter clasp?           O God! can I not save          One from the pitiless wave?           Is all that we see or seem          But a dream within a dream? 
                        

                        Out of the night that covers me,Black as the Pit from pole to pole,I thank whatever gods may beFor my unconquerable soul.In the fell clutch of circumstanceI have not winced nor cried aloud.Under the bludgeonings of chanceMy head is bloody, but unbowed.Beyond this place of wrath and tearsLooms but the Horror of the shade,And yet the menace of the yearsFinds, and shall find, me unafraid.It matters not how strait the gate,How charged with punishments the scroll.I am the master of my fate:I am the captain of my soul. 
                        

                        When I am an old woman I shall wear purpleWith a red hat which doesn't go, and doesn't suit me.And I shall spend my pension on brandy and summer glovesAnd satin sandals, and say we've no money for butter.I shall sit down on the pavement when I'm tiredAnd gobble up samples in shops and press alarm bellsAnd run my stick along the public railingsAnd make up for the sobriety of my youth.I shall go out in my slippers in the rainAnd pick flowers in other people's gardensAnd learn to spit.You can wear terrible shirts and grow more fatAnd eat three pounds of sausages at a goOr only bread and pickle for a weekAnd hoard pens and pencils and beermats and things in boxes.But now we must have clothes that keep us dryAnd pay our rent and not swear in the streetAnd set a good example for the children.We must have friends to dinner and read the papers.But maybe I ought to practice a little now?So people who know me are not too shocked and surprisedWhen suddenly I am old, and start to wear purple. 
                        

                        Do not go gentle into that good night,Old age should burn and rave at close of day; Rage, rage against the dying of the light.Though wise men at their end know dark is right,Because their words had forked no lightning theyDo not go gentle into that good night.Good men, the last wave by, crying how brightTheir frail deeds might have danced in a green bay,Rage, rage against the dying of the light.Wild men who caught and sang the sun in flight,And learn, too late, they grieved it on its way,Do not go gentle into that good night.Grave men, near death, who see with blinding sightBlind eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay,Rage, rage against the dying of the light.And you, my father, there on that sad height,Curse, bless, me now with your fierce tears, I pray.Do not go gentle into that good night.Rage, rage against the dying of the light. 
                        

                        Don't go far off, not even for a day, because -- because -- I don't know how to say it: a day is long and I will be waiting for you, as in an empty station when the trains are parked off somewhere else, asleep. Don't leave me, even for an hour, because then the little drops of anguish will all run together, the smoke that roams looking for a home will drift into me, choking my lost heart. Oh, may your silhouette never dissolve on the beach; may your eyelids never flutter into the empty distance. Don't leave me for a second, my dearest, because in that moment you'll have gone so far I'll wander mazily over all the earth, asking, Will you come back? Will you leave me here, dying? 
                        

                        From childhood's hour I have not been        As others were; I have not seen        As others saw; I could not bring        My passions from a common spring.        From the same source I have not taken        My sorrow; I could not awaken        My heart to joy at the same tone;        And all I loved, I loved alone.        Then- in my childhood, in the dawn        Of a most stormy life- was drawn        From every depth of good and ill        The mystery which binds me still:        From the torrent, or the fountain,        From the red cliff of the mountain,        From the sun that round me rolled        In its autumn tint of gold,        From the lightning in the sky        As it passed me flying by,        From the thunder and the storm,        And the cloud that took the form        (When the rest of Heaven was blue)        Of a demon in my view. 
                        

                        I was angry with my friend:I told my wrath, my wrath did end.I was angry with my foe:I told it not, my wrath did grow.And I watered it in fears,Night and morning with my tears; And I sunned it with smiles,And with soft deceitful wiles.And it grew both day and night,Till it bore an apple bright.And my foe beheld it shine.And he knew that it was mine,And into my garden stoleWhen the night had veiled the pole; In the morning glad I seeMy foe outstretched beneath the tree. 
                        

                        'Hope' is the thing with feathers—That perches in the soul—And sings the tune without the words—And never stops—at all—And sweetest—in the Gale—is heard—And sore must be the storm—That could abash the little BirdThat kept so many warm—I've heard it in the chillest land—And on the strangest Sea—Yet, never, in Extremity,It asked a crumb—of Me. 
                        

                        I wandered lonely as a cloudThat floats on high o'er vales and hills,When all at once I saw a crowd,A host, of golden daffodils; Beside the lake, beneath the trees,Fluttering and dancing in the breeze.Continuous as the stars that shineAnd twinkle on the milky way,They stretched in never-ending lineAlong the margin of a bay:Ten thousand saw I at a glance,Tossing their heads in sprightly dance.The waves beside them danced; but theyOut-did the sparkling waves in glee:A poet could not but be gay,In such a jocund company:I gazed- and gazed- but little thoughtWhat wealth the show to me had brought:For oft, when on my couch I lieIn vacant or in pensive mood,They flash upon that inward eyeWhich is the bliss of solitude; And then my heart with pleasure fills,And dances with the daffodils.

                        Well, son, I'll tell you:Life for me ain't been no crystal stair.It's had tacks in it,And splinters,And boards torn up,And places with no carpet on the floor—Bare.But all the time I'se been a-climbin' on,And reachin' landin's,And turnin' corners,And sometimes goin' in the darkWhere there ain't been no light.So, boy, don't you turn back.Don't you set down on the steps.'Cause you finds it's kinder hard.Don't you fall now—For I'se still goin', honey,I'se still climbin',And life for me ain't been no crystal stair. 
                        

                        All the world's a stage,And all the men and women merely players;They have their exits and their entrances,And one man in his time plays many parts,His acts being seven ages. At first, the infant,Mewling and puking in the nurse's arms.Then the whining schoolboy, with his satchelAnd shining morning face, creeping like snailUnwillingly to school. And then the lover,Sighing like furnace, with a woeful balladMade to his mistress' eyebrow. Then a soldier,Full of strange oaths and bearded like the pard,Jealous in honor, sudden and quick in quarrel,Seeking the bubble reputationEven in the cannon's mouth. And then the justice,In fair round belly with good capon lined,With eyes severe and beard of formal cut,Full of wise saws and modern instances;And so he plays his part. The sixth age shiftsInto the lean and slippered pantaloon,With spectacles on nose and pouch on side;His youthful hose, well saved, a world too wideFor his shrunk shank, and his big manly voice,Turning again toward childish treble, pipesAnd whistles in his sound. Last scene of all,That ends this strange eventful history,Is second childishness and mere oblivion,Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans everything. 
                        

                                                                  PART ONE                                                 I    THE wind was a torrent of darkness among the gusty trees,     The moon was a ghostly galleon tossed upon cloudy seas,     The road was a ribbon of moonlight over the purple moor,     And the highwayman came riding—                       Riding—riding—     The highwayman came riding, up to the old inn-door.                                                 II    He'd a French cocked-hat on his forehead, a bunch of lace at his chin,     A coat of the claret velvet, and breeches of brown doe-skin;     They fitted with never a wrinkle: his boots were up to the thigh!     And he rode with a jewelled twinkle,                       His pistol butts a-twinkle,     His rapier hilt a-twinkle, under the jewelled sky.                                                 III    Over the cobbles he clattered and clashed in the dark inn-yard,     And he tapped with his whip on the shutters, but all was locked and barred;     He whistled a tune to the window, and who should be waiting there     But the landlord's black-eyed daughter,                       Bess, the landlord's daughter,     Plaiting a dark red love-knot into her long black hair.                                                 IV    And dark in the dark old inn-yard a stable-wicket creaked     Where Tim the ostler listened; his face was white and peaked;     His eyes were hollows of madness, his hair like mouldy hay,     But he loved the landlord's daughter,                       The landlord's red-lipped daughter,     Dumb as a dog he listened, and he heard the robber say—                                                 V    'One kiss, my bonny sweetheart, I'm after a prize to-night,     But I shall be back with the yellow gold before the morning light;     Yet, if they press me sharply, and harry me through the day,     Then look for me by moonlight,                       Watch for me by moonlight,     I'll come to thee by moonlight, though hell should bar the way.'                                                 VI    He rose upright in the stirrups; he scarce could reach her hand,     But she loosened her hair i' the casement! His face burnt like a brand     As the black cascade of perfume came tumbling over his breast;     And he kissed its waves in the moonlight,                       (Oh, sweet, black waves in the moonlight!)     Then he tugged at his rein in the moonliglt, and galloped away to the West.                                         PART TWO                                                 I    He did not come in the dawning; he did not come at noon;     And out o' the tawny sunset, before the rise o' the moon,     When the road was a gypsy's ribbon, looping the purple moor,     A red-coat troop came marching—                       Marching—marching—     King George's men came matching, up to the old inn-door.                                                 II    They said no word to the landlord, they drank his ale instead,     But they gagged his daughter and bound her to the foot of her narrow bed;     Two of them knelt at her casement, with muskets at their side!     There was death at every window;                       And hell at one dark window;     For Bess could see, through her casement, the road that he would ride.                                                 III    They had tied her up to attention, with many a sniggering jest;     They had bound a musket beside her, with the barrel beneath her breast!     'Now, keep good watch!' and they kissed her.                       She heard the dead man say—     Look for me by moonlight;                       Watch for me by moonlight;     I'll come to thee by moonlight, though hell should bar the way!                                                 IV    She twisted her hands behind her; but all the knots held good!     She writhed her hands till her fingers were wet with sweat or blood!     They stretched and strained in the darkness, and the hours crawled by like years,     Till, now, on the stroke of midnight,                       Cold, on the stroke of midnight,     The tip of one finger touched it! The trigger at least was hers!                                                 V    The tip of one finger touched it; she strove no more for the rest!     Up, she stood up to attention, with the barrel beneath her breast,     She would not risk their hearing; she would not strive again;     For the road lay bare in the moonlight;                       Blank and bare in the moonlight;     And the blood of her veins in the moonlight throbbed to her love's refrain .                                                 VI        Tlot-tlot; tlot-tlot! Had they heard it? The horse-hoofs ringing clear;     Tlot-tlot, tlot-tlot, in the distance? Were they deaf that they did not hear?     Down the ribbon of moonlight, over the brow of the hill,     The highwayman came riding,                       Riding, riding!     The red-coats looked to their priming! She stood up, straight and still!                                                 VII    Tlot-tlot, in the frosty silence! Tlot-tlot, in the echoing night!     Nearer he came and nearer! Her face was like a light!     Her eyes grew wide for a moment; she drew one last deep breath,     Then her finger moved in the moonlight,                       Her musket shattered the moonlight,     Shattered her breast in the moonlight and warned him—with her death.                                                 VIII    He turned; he spurred to the West; he did not know who stood     Bowed, with her head o'er the musket, drenched with her own red blood!     Not till the dawn he heard it, his face grew grey to hear     How Bess, the landlord's daughter,                       The landlord's black-eyed daughter,     Had watched for her love in the moonlight, and died in the darkness there.                                                 IX    Back, he spurred like a madman, shrieking a curse to the sky,     With the white road smoking behind him and his rapier brandished high!     Blood-red were his spurs i' the golden noon; wine-red was his velvet coat,     When they shot him down on the highway,                       Down like a dog on the highway,     And he lay in his blood on the highway, with the bunch of lace at his throat.                                                 X    And still of a winter's night, they say, when the wind is in the trees,     When the moon is a ghostly galleon tossed upon cloudy seas,     When the road is a ribbon of moonlight over the purple moor,     A highwayman comes riding—                       Riding—riding—     A highwayman comes riding, up to the old inn-door.                                                 XI    Over the cobbles he clatters and clangs in the dark inn-yard;     He taps with his whip on the shutters, but all is locked and barred;     He whistles a tune to the window, and who should be waiting there     But the landlord's black-eyed daughter,                       Bess, the landlord's daughter,     Plaiting a dark red love-knot into her long black hair.

                        The time will come when, with elation you will greet yourself arriving at your own door, in your own mirror and each will smile at the other's welcome, and say, sit here. Eat. You will love again the stranger who was your self.Give wine. Give bread. Give back your heart to itself, to the stranger who has loved you all your life, whom you ignored for another, who knows you by heart. Take down the love letters from the bookshelf, the photographs, the desperate notes, peel your own image from the mirror. Sit. Feast on your life. 
                        

                        No man is an island,Entire of itself,Every man is a piece of the continent,A part of the main.If a clod be washed away by the sea,Europe is the less.As well as if a promontory were.As well as if a manor of thy friend'sOr of thine own were:Any man's death diminishes me,Because I am involved in mankind,And therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls; It tolls for thee. 
                        

   O CAPTAIN! my Captain! our fearful trip is done;   The ship has weather'd every rack, the prize we sought is won;   The port is near, the bells I hear, the people all exulting,   While follow eyes the steady keel, the vessel grim and daring:       But O heart! heart! heart!         O the bleeding drops of red,           Where on the deck my Captain lies,             Fallen cold and dead.   O Captain! my Captain! rise up and hear the bells;   Rise up--for you the flag is flung--for you the bugle trills;      10   For you bouquets and ribbon'd wreaths--for you the shores a-crowding;   For you they call, the swaying mass, their eager faces turning;       Here Captain! dear father!         This arm beneath your head;           It is some dream that on the deck,             You've fallen cold and dead.   My Captain does not answer, his lips are pale and still;   My father does not feel my arm, he has no pulse nor will;   The ship is anchor'd safe and sound, its voyage closed and done;   From fearful trip, the victor ship, comes in with object won;      20       Exult, O shores, and ring, O bells!         But I, with mournful tread,           Walk the deck my Captain lies,             Fallen cold and dead.

                        In England once there lived a bigAnd wonderfully clever pig.To everybody it was plainThat Piggy had a massive brain.He worked out sums inside his head,There was no book he hadn't read.He knew what made an airplane fly,He knew how engines worked and why.He knew all this, but in the endOne question drove him round the bend:He simply couldn't puzzle outWhat LIFE was really all about.What was the reason for his birth? Why was he placed upon this earth? His giant brain went round and round.Alas, no answer could be found.Till suddenly one wondrous night.All in a flash he saw the light.He jumped up like a ballet dancerAnd yelled, 'By gum, I've got the answer! ''They want my bacon slice by slice'To sell at a tremendous price! 'They want my tender juicy chops'To put in all the butcher's shops! 'They want my pork to make a roast'And that's the part'll cost the most! 'They want my sausages in strings! 'They even want my chitterlings! 'The butcher's shop! The carving knife! 'That is the reason for my life! 'Such thoughts as these are not designedTo give a pig great peace of mind.Next morning, in comes Farmer Bland,A pail of pigswill in his hand,And piggy with a mighty roar,Bashes the farmer to the floor…Now comes the rather grisly bitSo let's not make too much of it,Except that you must understandThat Piggy did eat Farmer Bland,He ate him up from head to toe,Chewing the pieces nice and slow.It took an hour to reach the feet,Because there was so much to eat,And when he finished, Pig, of course,Felt absolutely no remorse.Slowly he scratched his brainy headAnd with a little smile he said,'I had a fairly powerful hunch'That he might have me for his lunch.'And so, because I feared the worst,'I thought I'd better eat him first.'

                        Tell me not, in mournful numbers,Life is but an empty dream! For the soul is dead that slumbers,And things are not what they seem.Life is real! Life is earnest! And the grave is not its goal; Dust thou art, to dust returnest,Was not spoken of the soul.Not enjoyment, and not sorrow,Is our destined end or way; But to act, that each to-morrowFind us farther than to-day.Art is long, and Time is fleeting,And our hearts, though stout and brave,Still, like muffled drums, are beatingFuneral marches to the grave.In the world’s broad field of battle,In the bivouac of Life,Be not like dumb, driven cattle! Be a hero in the strife! Trust no Future, howe’er pleasant! Let the dead Past bury its dead! Act,— act in the living Present! Heart within, and God o’erhead! Lives of great men all remind usWe can make our lives sublime,And, departing, leave behind usFootprints on the sands of time; Footprints, that perhaps another,Sailing o’er life’s solemn main,A forlorn and shipwrecked brother,Seeing, shall take heart again.Let us, then, be up and doing,With a heart for any fate; Still achieving, still pursuing,Learn to labor and to wait.

                        Over hill, over dale,Thorough bush, thorough brier,Over park, over pale,Thorough flood, thorough fire!I do wander everywhere,Swifter than the moon's sphere;And I serve the Fairy Queen,To dew her orbs upon the green;The cowslips tall her pensioners be;In their gold coats spots you see;Those be rubies, fairy favours;In those freckles live their savours;I must go seek some dewdrops here,And hang a pearl in every cowslip's ear. 
                        

                        How do I love thee? Let me count the ways. I love thee to the depth and breadth and height My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight For the ends of Being and ideal Grace. I love thee to the level of every day's Most quiet need, by sun and candlelight. I love thee freely, as men strive for Right; I love thee purely, as they turn from Praise. I love with a passion put to use In my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith. I love thee with a love I seemed to lose With my lost saints, -- I love thee with the breath, Smiles, tears, of all my life! -- and, if God choose, I shall but love thee better after death. 
                        

                        Remember me when I am gone away,         Gone far away into the silent land;         When you can no more hold me by the hand,     Nor I half turn to go yet turning stay.     Remember me when no more day by day         You tell me of our future that you plann'd:         Only remember me; you understand     It will be late to counsel then or pray.     Yet if you should forget me for a while       And afterwards remember, do not grieve:       For if the darkness and corruption leave       A vestige of the thoughts that once I had,   Better by far you should forget and smile       Than that you should remember and be sad.

                        A thing of beauty is a joy for ever: Its lovliness increases; it will never Pass into nothingness; but still will keep A bower quiet for us, and a sleep Full of sweet dreams, and health, and quiet breathing. Therefore, on every morrow, are we wreathing A flowery band to bind us to the earth, Spite of despondence, of the inhuman dearth Of noble natures, of the gloomy days, Of all the unhealthy and o'er-darkn'd ways Made for our searching: yes, in spite of all, Some shape of beauty moves away the pall From our dark spirits. Such the sun, the moon, Trees old and young, sprouting a shady boon For simple sheep; and such are daffodils With the green world they live in; and clear rills That for themselves a cooling covert make 'Gainst the hot season; the mid-forest brake, Rich with a sprinkling of fair musk-rose blooms: And such too is the grandeur of the dooms We have imagined for the mighty dead; An endless fountain of immortal drink, Pouring unto us from the heaven's brink. 
                        

                        A millionbillionwillion miles from homeWaiting for the bell to go. (To go where?)Why are they all so big, other children?So noisy? So much at home theyMust have been born in uniformLived all their lives in playgroundsSpent the years inventing gamesThat don't let me in. GamesThat are rough, that swallow you up.And the railings.All around, the railings.Are they to keep out wolves and monsters?Things that carry off and eat children?Things you don't take sweets from?Perhaps they're to stop us getting outRunning away from the lessins. Lessin.What does a lessin look like?Sounds small and slimy.They keep them in the glassrooms.Whole rooms made out of glass. Imagine.I wish I could remember my nameMummy said it would come in useful.Like wellies. When there's puddles.Yellowwellies. I wish she was here.I think my name is sewn on somewherePerhaps the teacher will read it for me.Tea-cher. The one who makes the tea.

One two! And through and throughThe vorpal blade went snicker-snack!He left it dead, and with its headHe went galumphing back.'And hast thou slain the Jabberwock?Come to my arms, my beamish boy!Oh frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!'He chortled in his joy.'Twas brillig, and the slithy tovesDid gyre and gimble in the wabe:All mimsy were the borogoves,And the mome raths outgrabe. 
                        

                        I met a traveller from an antique landWho said: `Two vast and trunkless legs of stoneStand in the desert. Near them, on the sand,Half sunk, a shattered visage lies, whose frown,And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,Tell that its sculptor  well those passions readWhich yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,The hand that mocked them and the heart that fed.And on the pedestal these words appear --"My name is Ozymandias, king of kings:Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!"Nothing beside remains. Round the decayOf that colossal wreck, boundless and bareThe lone and level sands stretch far away.' 
                        

                        And death shall have no dominion.Dead man naked they shall be oneWith the man in the wind and the west moon; When their bones are picked clean and the clean bones gone,They shall have stars at elbow and foot; Though they go mad they shall be sane,Though they sink through the sea they shall rise again; Though lovers be lost love shall not; And death shall have no dominion.And death shall have no dominion.Under the windings of the seaThey lying long shall not die windily; Twisting on racks when sinews give way,Strapped to a wheel, yet they shall not break; Faith in their hands shall snap in two,And the unicorn evils run them through; Split all ends up they shan't crack; And death shall have no dominion.And death shall have no dominion.No more may gulls cry at their earsOr waves break loud on the seashores; Where blew a flower may a flower no moreLift its head to the blows of the rain; Though they be mad and dead as nails,Heads of the characters hammer through daisies; Break in the sun till the sun breaks down,And death shall have no dominion.

                        Bent double, like old beggars under sacks,Knock-kneed, coughing like hags, we cursed through sludge,Till on the haunting flares we turned out backs,And towards our distant rest began to trudge.Men marched asleep. Many had lost their boots,But limped on, blood-shod. All went lame, all blind; Drunk with fatigue; deaf even to the hootsOf gas-shells dropping softly behind.Gas! GAS! Quick, boys! - An ecstasy of fumblingFitting the clumsy helmets just in time,But someone still was yelling out and stumblingAnd flound'ring like a man in fire or lime.- Dim through the misty panes and thick green light,As under a green sea, I saw him drowning.In all my dreams before my helpless sightHe plunges at me, guttering, choking, drowning.If in some smothering dreams, you too could paceBehind the wagon that we flung him in,And watch the white eyes writhing in his face,His hanging face, like a devil's sick of sin,If you could hear, at every jolt, the bloodCome gargling from the froth-corrupted lungsObscene as cancer, bitter as the cudOf vile, incurable sores on innocent tongues,- My friend, you would not tell with such high zestTo children ardent for some desperate glory,The old Lie: Dulce et decorum estPro patria mori.

                        I think that I shall never see	 A poem lovely as a tree.	  A tree whose hungry mouth is prest	 Against the earth's sweet flowing breast; 	  A tree that looks at God all day,	         And lifts her leafy arms to pray; 	  A tree that may in summer wear	 A nest of robins in her hair; 	  Upon whose bosom snow has lain; 	 Who intimately lives with rain.	  Poems are made by fools like me,	 But only God can make a tree. 
                        

                        We wear the mask that grins and lies,It hides our cheeks and shades our eyes,--This debt we pay to human guile;With torn and bleeding hearts we smile,And mouth with myriad subtleties.Why should the world be overwise,In counting all our tears and sighs?Nay, let them only see us, whileWe wear the mask.We smile, but, O great Christ, our criesTo thee from tortured souls arise.We sing, but oh the clay is vileBeneath our feet, and long the mile;But let the world dream otherwise,We wear the mask! 
                        

                        Tyger! Tyger! burning bright, In the forests of the night, What immortal hand or eye Could frame thy fearful symmetry? In what distant deeps or skies Burnt the fire of thine eyes? On what wings dare he aspire? What the hand dare sieze the fire? And what shoulder, & what art, Could twist the sinews of thy heart? And when thy heart began to beat, What dread hand? & what dread feet? What the hammer? what the chain? In what furnace was thy brain? What the anvil? what dread grasp Dare its deadly terrors clasp? When the stars threw down their spears, And water'd heaven with their tears, Did he smile his work to see? Did he who made the Lamb make thee? Tyger! Tyger! burning bright In the forests of the night, What immortal hand or eye Dare frame thy fearful symmetry?

                        This girlchild was born as usualand presented dolls that did pee-peeand miniature GE stoves and ironsand wee lipsticks the color of cherry candy.Then in the magic of puberty, a classmate said:You have a great big nose and fat legs. She was healthy, tested intelligent,possessed strong arms and back,abundant sexual drive and manual dexterity.She went to and fro apologizing.Everyone saw a fat nose on thick legs. She was advised to play coy,exhorted to come on hearty,exercise, diet, smile and wheedle.Her good nature wore outlike a fan belt.So she cut off her nose and her legsand offered them up. In the casket displayed on satin she laywith the undertaker's cosmetics painted on,a turned-up putty nose,dressed in a pink and white nightie.Doesn't she look pretty? everyone said.Consummation at last.To every woman a happy ending. 
                        

                        The art of losing isn't hard to master; so many things seem filled with the intentto be lost that their loss is no disaster,Lose something every day. Accept the flusterof lost door keys, the hour badly spent.The art of losing isn't hard to master.Then practice losing farther, losing faster:places, and names, and where it was you meantto travel. None of these will bring disaster.I lost my mother's watch. And look! my last, ornext-to-last, of three loved houses went.The art of losing isn't hard to master.I lost two cities, lovely ones. And, vaster,some realms I owned, two rivers, a continent.I miss them, but it wasn't a disaster.- Even losing you (the joking voice, a gestureI love)    I shan't have lied. It's evidentthe art of losing's not too hard to masterthough it may look like (Write it!)    like disaster. 
                        

                        Beautiful is the 'thank you'Wrapped with gratitude, Offered to peace prone peopleWho offer what is real-themselvesTo nurse  with love and humilitynapalm asphyxiated victims in our stained worldveiling ambition with face ofhumanity.Beautiful is the momentwhen sunlit world fades away And with it mind made mirror While look inward drawn, sight insight led, and heart shuts out desire to let inconsciousness. 
                        

                        Bright star, would I were stedfast as thou art-         Not in lone splendour hung aloft the night   And watching, with eternal lids apart,       Like nature's patient, sleepless Eremite,   The moving waters at their priestlike task       Of pure ablution round earth's human shores,   Or gazing on the new soft-fallen mask       Of snow upon the mountains and the moors-    No- yet still stedfast, still unchangeable,       Pillow'd upon my fair love's ripening breast,   To feel for ever its soft fall and swell,       Awake for ever in a sweet unrest,   Still, still to hear her tender-taken breath,   And so live ever- or else swoon to death. 
                        

                        The Peace Warrior Of Mzansi, among heroes - a colossus! Sun Of The Nation; A rare gift of Providence.Once, entangled in the web of racist succubus; Unruffled he declares before High Justice: '[I]t is an ideal for which I am prepared to die.' Silence -Pregnant with dreadful menace in court ensued.A beast of burden consequent of unshakeable stance.In the slammer Symbol Of The Struggle he attained; But Apartheid demon persisted in its Treachery.'Coalition Of Conscience' inspired outcry for Liberty; Plagues of sanctions shatter manacles of Slavery.Looming on the horizon - a sight of Equality.From abyss of darkness emerged the Institution; The Immortal Icon and Mastermind of Rainbow Nation.NOTE: This compact synopsis of Dr Nelson Madiba Mandela is a story about his journey from The Rivonia Trial (where he was charged with TREASON - an offence carrying death penalty by HANGING) to Freedom and Democracy.He was after much... sentenced to life imprisonment with hard labour. The piece is a poetic portrait of the cosmopolitan juggernaut, whose enigmatic radiance of love was tested far beyond the experience flesh has to endure. It is a soulful tale of the great icon of peaceful resistance, who had gone from prison (for 27 years)to become the first democratically elected President of South Africa.May his wonderful and gentle soul continue to rest in the Bosom Of Almighty God.Mzansi is another name for South Africa - an affectionate name. 
                        

                        Death is nothing at all.I have only slipped away to the next room.I am I and you are you.Whatever we were to each other, That, we still are.Call me by my old familiar name.Speak to me in the easy waywhich you always used.Put no difference into your tone.Wear no forced air of solemnity or sorrow.Laugh as we always laughedat the little jokes we enjoyed together.Play, smile, think of me.  Pray for me.Let my name be ever the household wordthat it always was.Let it be spoken without effect.Without the trace of a shadow on it.Life means all that it ever meant.It is the same that it ever was.There is absolute unbroken continuity.Why should I be out of mindbecause I am out of sight? I am but waiting for you.For an interval.Somewhere. Very near.Just around the corner.All is well.Nothing is past; nothing is lost. One brief moment and all will be as it was before only better, infinitely happier and forever we will all be one together with Christ. 
                        

                        Whenever Richard Cory went down town,We people on the pavement looked at him:He was a gentleman from sole to crown,Clean favored, and imperially slim.And he was always quietly arrayed,And he was always human when he talked; But still he fluttered pulses when he said,'Good-morning,' and he glittered when he walked.And he was rich - yes, richer than a king -And admirably schooled in every grace:In fine, we thought that he was everythingTo make us wish that we were in his place.So on we worked, and waited for the light,And went without the meat, and cursed the bread; And Richard Cory, one calm summer night,Went home and put a bullet through his head. 
                        

                        Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?Thou art more lovely and more temperate.Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,And summer's lease hath all too short a date.Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,And often is his gold complexion dimmed;And every fair from fair sometime declines,By chance, or nature's changing course, untrimmed;But thy eternal summer shall not fade,Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow'st,Nor shall death brag thou wand'rest in his shade,When in eternal lines to Time thou grow'st. So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see, So long lives this, and this gives life to thee. 
                        

                        The neighbors' dog will not stop barking.He is barking the same high, rhythmic barkthat he barks every time they leave the house.They must switch him on on their way out.The neighbors' dog will not stop barking.I close all the windows in the houseand put on a Beethoven symphony full blastbut I can still hear him muffled under the music,barking, barking, barking,and now I can see him sitting in the orchestra,his head raised confidently as if Beethovenhad included a part for barking dog.When the record finally ends he is still barking,sitting there in the oboe section barking,his eyes fixed on the conductor who isentreating him with his batonwhile the other musicians listen in respectfulsilence to the famous barking dog solo,that endless coda that first establishedBeethoven as an innovative genius. 
                        

                        Be glad your nose is on your face,not pasted on some other place,for if it were where it is not,you might dislike your nose a lot.Imagine if your precious nosewere sandwiched in between your toes,that clearly would not be a treat,for you'd be forced to smell your feet.Your nose would be a source of dreadwere it attached atop your head,it soon would drive you to despair,forever tickled by your hair.Within your ear, your nose would bean absolute catastrophe,for when you were obliged to sneeze,your brain would rattle from the breeze.Your nose, instead, through thick and thin,remains between your eyes and chin,not pasted on some other place--be glad your nose is on your face! 
                        

                        I am in need of music that would flowOver my fretful, feeling fingertips,Over my bitter-tainted, trembling lips,With melody, deep, clear, and liquid-slow.Oh, for the healing swaying, old and low,Of some song sung to rest the tired dead,A song to fall like water on my head,And over quivering limbs, dream flushed to glow!There is a magic made by melody:A spell of rest, and quiet breath, and coolHeart, that sinks through fading colors deepTo the subaqueous stillness of the sea,And floats forever in a moon-green pool,Held in the arms of rhythm and of sleep. 
                        

                        A woman who my mother knowsCame in and took off all her clothes.Said I, not being very old,'By golly gosh, you must be cold!''No, no!' she cried. 'Indeed I'm not!I'm feeling devilishly hot!' 
                        

                        Take some Picts, Celts and SiluresAnd let them settle,Then overrun them with Roman conquerors. Remove the Romans after approximately 400 yearsAdd lots of Norman French to someAngles, Saxons, Jutes and Vikings, then stir vigorously. Mix some hot Chileans, cool Jamaicans, Dominicans,Trinidadians and Bajans with some Ethiopians, Chinese,Vietnamese and Sudanese. Then take a blend of Somalians, Sri Lankans, NigeriansAnd Pakistanis, Combine with some GuyaneseAnd turn up the heat. Sprinkle some fresh Indians, Malaysians, Bosnians,Iraqis and Bangladeshis together with someAfghans, Spanish, Turkish, Kurdish, JapaneseAnd Palestinians Then add to the melting pot. Leave the ingredients to simmer. As they mix and blend allow their languages to flourishBinding them together with English. Allow time to be cool.Add some unity, understanding, and respect for the future,Serve with justiceAnd enjoy. Note: All the ingredients are equally important.

                        Isabel met an enormous bear,Isabel, Isabel, didn't care;The bear was hungry, the bear was ravenous,The bear's big mouth was cruel and cavernous.The bear said, Isabel, glad to meet you,How do, Isabel, now I'll eat you!Isabel, Isabel, didn't worry.Isabel didn't scream or scurry.She washed her hands and she straightened her hair up,Then Isabel quietly ate the bear up.Once in a night as black as pitchIsabel met a wicked old witch.the witch's face was cross and wrinkled,The witch's gums with teeth were sprinkled.Ho, ho, Isabel! the old witch crowed,I'll turn you into an ugly toad!Isabel, Isabel, didn't worry,Isabel didn't scream or scurry,She showed no rage and she showed no rancor,But she turned the witch into milk and drank her.Isabel met a hideous giant,Isabel continued self reliant.The giant was hairy, the giant was horrid,He had one eye in the middle of his forhead.Good morning, Isabel, the giant said,I'll grind your bones to make my bread.Isabel, Isabel, didn't worry,Isabel didn't scream or scurry.She nibled the zwieback that she always fed off,And when it was gone, she cut the giant's head off.Isabel met a troublesome doctor,He punched and he poked till he really shocked her.The doctor's talk was of coughs and chillsAnd the doctor's satchel bulged with pills.The doctor said unto Isabel,Swallow this, it will make you well.Isabel, Isabel, didn't worry,Isabel didn't scream or scurry.She took those pills from the pill concocter,And Isabel calmly cured the doctor. 
                        

                        The whole idea of it makes me feellike I'm coming down with something,something worse than any stomach acheor the headaches I get from reading in bad light--a kind of measles of the spirit,a mumps of the psyche,a disfiguring chicken pox of the soul.You tell me it is too early to be looking back,but that is because you have forgottenthe perfect simplicity of being oneand the beautiful complexity introduced by two.But I can lie on my bed and remember every digit.At four I was an Arabian wizard.I could make myself invisibleby drinking a glass of milk a certain way.At seven I was a soldier, at nine a prince.But now I am mostly at the windowwatching the late afternoon light.Back then it never fell so solemnlyagainst the side of my tree house,and my bicycle never leaned against the garageas it does today,all the dark blue speed drained out of it.This is the beginning of sadness, I say to myself,as I walk through the universe in my sneakers.It is time to say good-bye to my imaginary friends,time to turn the first big number.It seems only yesterday I used to believethere was nothing under my skin but light.If you cut me I could shine.But now when I fall upon the sidewalks of life,I skin my knees. I bleed. 
                        

                        Death be not proud, though some have called theeMighty and dreadfull, for, thou art not soe,For, those, whom thou think'st, thou dost overthrow,Die not, poore death, nor yet canst thou kill mee.From rest and sleepe, which but thy pictures bee,Much pleasure, then from thee, much more must flow,And soonest our best men with thee doe goe,Rest of their bones, and soules deliverie.Thou art slave to Fate, Chance, kings, and desperate men,And dost with poyson, warre, and sicknesse dwell,And poppie, or charmes can make us sleepe as well,And better then thy stroake; why swell'st thou then?One short sleepe past, wee wake eternally,And death shall be no more; death, thou shalt die. 
                        

                        Last night I dreamed of chickens,there were chickens everywhere,they were standing on my stomach,they were nesting in my hair,they were pecking at my pillow,they were hopping on my head,they were ruffling up their feathersas they raced about my bed.They were on the chairs and tables,they were on the chandeliers,they were roosting in the corners,they were clucking in my ears,there were chickens, chickens, chickensfor as far as I could see...when I woke today, I noticedthere were eggs on top of me. 
                        

                        Laugh, and the world laughs with you; Weep, and you weep alone.For the sad old earth must borrow its mirth,But has trouble enough of its own.Sing, and the hills will answer; Sigh, it is lost on the air.The echoes bound to a joyful sound,But shrink from voicing care.Rejoice, and men will seek you; Grieve, and they turn and go.They want full measure of all your pleasure,But they do not need your woe.Be glad, and your friends are many; Be sad, and you lose them all.There are none to decline your nectared wine,But alone you must drink life's gall.Feast, and your halls are crowded; Fast, and the world goes by.Succeed and give, and it helps you live,But no man can help you die.There is room in the halls of pleasureFor a long and lordly train,But one by one we must all file onThrough the narrow aisles of pain. 
                        

                        WHEN you are old and grey and full of sleep,And nodding by the fire, take down this book,And slowly read, and dream of the soft lookYour eyes had once, and of their shadows deep;How many loved your moments of glad grace,And loved your beauty with love false or true,But one man loved the pilgrim Soul in you,And loved the sorrows of your changing face;And bending down beside the glowing bars,Murmur, a little sadly, how Love fledAnd paced upon the mountains overheadAnd hid his face amid a crowd of stars. 
                        

                        The name of the author is the first to gofollowed obediently by the title, the plot,the heartbreaking conclusion, the entire novelwhich suddenly becomes one you have never read,never even heard of,as if, one by one, the memories you used to harbordecided to retire to the southern hemisphere of the brain,to a little fishing village where there are no phones.Long ago you kissed the names of the nine Muses goodbyeand watched the quadratic equation pack its bag,and even now as you memorize the order of the planets,something else is slipping away, a state flower perhaps,the address of an uncle, the capital of Paraguay.Whatever it is you are struggling to remember,it is not poised on the tip of your tongue,not even lurking in some obscure corner of your spleen.It has floated away down a dark mythological riverwhose name begins with an L as far as you can recall,well on your own way to oblivion where you will join thosewho have even forgotten how to swim and how to ride a bicycle.No wonder you rise in the middle of the nightto look up the date of a famous battle in a book on war.No wonder the moon in the window seems to have driftedout of a love poem that you used to know by heart. 
                        

                        O my Luve's like a red, red roseThat's newly sprung in June; O my Luve's like the melodieThat's sweetly play'd in tune.As fair art thou, my bonnie lass,So deep in luve am I:And I will luve thee still, my dear,Till a' the seas gang dry:Till a' the seas gang dry, my dear,And the rocks melt wi' the sun:I will luve thee still, my dear,While the sands o' life shall run.And fare thee well, my only LuveAnd fare thee well, a while! And I will come again, my Luve,Tho' it were ten thousand mile. 
                        

                        No earthquake, no thunder, no volcanic eruptionOr even there was not any of other natural calamities, A sudden loud sound broke out all through the bushWith whizzing, shuddering, cracking, tearing, echoing, Fear, horror, dark, terror, misery and ill spirits spreadCommitting destruction, death in a horrible situation, Dust, dirt, smoke coiled over the whole atmosphereThe harmless animals are quite perplexed, helplessThey began crying, shouting, running, rushing, faintingSeeing reddish spots and innumerable torn bodies.They blamed one another for committing the crime, Brawling, harming, plotting hardened in them, A long conflict complicated and awful tangledLoosing the worms of crime, injustice and corruption; The virtues sunk and the vices rose everywhereEnvious state of barbarism, terrorism inflicted on them; The poor animals lost peace and principles they hadCenturies curses engulfed all what was out of thought.Ferocious animals are in the neighboring big forestWho always wait for chances on the helpless ones; They do not care for hesitating in violating terms Committing all sorts of hyenas and monstrous harms; They know how and when to cook poisonous brothAnd how to throw an unseen net to catch the rest.Once some cats were quarrelling nearby the bushSome wild dogs of the big forest made an instant rush, For repeated barking mewing was beyond of hearingFoxes and monkeys also joined within a quick hasteCrows, kites and vultures started crowing for the feastWhat more, rats and mice left the bush being frightenedDreadful tumult, commotion, collision, conflict took place At the arrival of buffalos, deer, bears, wolfs and hyenas; But with sudden and unexpected appearance ofJaguars, lions, tigers and some bears' rejoining to themReturning from the herd of small and weak beastsConsisting boars, wolfs, hyenas, wild pigs and dogs, Though wolfs and hyenas started loudly barkingBut came to no use and got chased, retreated soon, All the surroundings became instant silent and isolated, All went away murmuring without more looking back.The victorious were excited having got all easy victory, But they found troubles to enjoy the whole empire lonely, So there were roaring, shouting, blustering, threateningOf occupying empire, power, lordship and over lordship, Finally, all the bestial rules with ‘Might is right' wereEstablished in rules and regulations less animal state.Copyright © Muzahidul Reza | 6 October, 2016 
                        

                        I loved you, and I probably still do,And for a while the feeling may remain...But let my love no longer trouble you,I do not wish to cause you any pain.I loved you; and the hopelessness I knew,The jealousy, the shyness - though in vain -Made up a love so tender and so trueAs may God grant you to be loved again.Translated by Genia Gurarie, 11/10/95 
                        

                        THIS is thy hour O Soul, thy free flight into the wordless,   Away from books, away from art, the day erased, the lesson done,   Thee fully forth emerging, silent, gazing, pondering the themes thou         lovest best.   Night, sleep, death and the stars. 
                        

                        If you die before meI would jump down into your graveand hug you so innocentlythat angels will become jealous.I shall kiss you.So intimately shall I kiss youthat your breath becomes mine.In one breath of love shall we merge into hugs of true joy.Your heart shall beatin rhythms unheardlike the drums of the desertand the wild forest in the night.You shall murmur in my ears: 'Ohpress me to your chest; Tear open your chest, Make way for me to enter into your loving heartthat beats only for me in resounding colors.Tell me please Oh my loverIs it a rainbow that I see? or the glow of a burning pyre? Why is it that I cannot utter it in words? Tell me glorious angels of love: What am I experiencing in uncountablemoments of indescribable inner comfort? Shivering in your presenceI shall long to dance with you.If the dark souls lead you to HadesI will dance and dance with youeven in the nether world.We shall dance soft and then wild.We shall dance togetheras one body and soul and break the fetters of hellthrough love that emanates from our dance.Dance so long and fine like a poemuntil the Lords of the dark would faint.Breaking the fetters of Hadesthe white angelsattired in beautyshall fly down to pick you up on golden cradlesand carry you to the world of God.Soyou will be free and fly away from me into the world of the heavenswhere angels shall kiss your sacred body.You will be attired in gold and whiteand in varied colors in tune with the flowers of heaven.Then you need no space to live and breathe.Into that world of purity you will goand I will be here on earthdreaming of your joys with the Heavenly spirits.Shall I wait? Shall I wait at dusk and dawnin sobs and a heaving heartwith such desire and passionto reach you one day in your world of happiness.(It is the belief that once your lady love dies before you, she has to go to the Hades and there she has to dance so fiercely and lovingly to make the Lords of Darkness faint and then she shall be free from the chains of hell.Here the living lover is ready to go to hell to dance with her most fiercely and save her from the hell) 
                        

                        The fountains mingle with the river,     And the rivers with the ocean; The winds of heaven mix forever          With a sweet emotion; Nothing in the world is single;      All things by a law divineIn another's being mingle-           Why not I with thine? See, the mountains kiss high heaven,     And the waves clasp one another; No sister flower could be forgiven          If it disdained its brother; And the sunlight clasps the earth,     And the moonbeams kiss the sea; - What are all these kissings worth,          If thou kiss not me? 
                        

                        "Is there anybody there?" said the Traveller,Knocking on the moonlit door;And his horse in the silence champed the grassOf the forest's ferny floor;And a bird flew up out of the turret,Above the Traveller's head:And he smote upon the door again a second time;"Is there anybody there?" he said.But no one descended to the Traveller;No head from the leaf-fringed sillLeaned over and looked into his grey eyes,Where he stood perplexed and still.But only a host of phantom listenersThat dwelt in the lone house thenStood listening in the quiet of the moonlightTo that voice from the world of men:Stood thronging the faint moonbeams on the dark stair,That goes down to the empty hall,Hearkening in an air stirred and shakenBy the lonely Traveller's call.And he felt in his heart their strangeness,Their stillness answering his cry,While his horse moved, cropping the dark turf,'Neath the starred and leafy sky;For he suddenly smote on the door, evenLouder, and lifted his head:--"Tell them I came, and no one answered,That I kept my word," he said.Never the least stir made the listeners,Though every word he spakeFell echoing through the shadowiness of the still houseFrom the one man left awake:Ay, they heard his foot upon the stirrup,And the sound of iron on stone,And how the silence surged softly backward,When the plunging hoofs were gone.

                        You're sad because you're sad.It's psychic. It's the age. It's chemical.Go see a shrink or take a pill,or hug your sadness like an eyeless dollyou need to sleep.Well, all children are sadbut some get over it.Count your blessings. Better than that,buy a hat. Buy a coat or pet.Take up dancing to forget.Forget what? Your sadness, your shadow,whatever it was that was done to youthe day of the lawn partywhen you came inside flushed with the sun,your mouth sulky with sugar,in your new dress with the ribbonand the ice-cream smear,and said to yourself in the bathroom,I am not the favorite child.My darling, when it comesright down to itand the light fails and the fog rolls inand you're trapped in your overturned bodyunder a blanket or burning car,and the red flame is seeping out of youand igniting the tarmac beside your heador else the floor, or else the pillow,none of us is; or else we all are. 
                        

                        Said Hamlet to Ophelia,I'll draw a sketch of thee,What kind of pencil shall I use? 2B or not 2B? 
                        

                        When I consider how my light is spentEre half my days in this dark world and wide,And that one talent which is death to hideLodg'd with me useless, though my soul more bentTo serve therewith my Maker, and presentMy true account, lest he returning chide,"Doth God exact day-labour, light denied?"I fondly ask. But Patience, to preventThat murmur, soon replies: "God doth not needEither man's work or his own gifts: who bestBear his mild yoke, they serve him best. His stateIs kingly; thousands at his bidding speedAnd post o'er land and ocean without rest:They also serve who only stand and wait." 
                        

                        I am: yet what I am none cares or knows,My friends forsake me like a memory lost; I am the self-consumer of my woes,They rise and vanish in oblivious host,Like shades in love and death's oblivion lost; And yet I am! and live with shadows tostInto the nothingness of scorn and noise,Into the living sea of waking dreams,Where there is neither sense of life nor joys,But the vast shipwreck of my life's esteems; And e'en the dearest- that I loved the best- Are strange- nay, rather stranger than the rest.I long for scenes where man has never trod; A place where woman never smil'd or wept; There to abide with my creator, God,And sleep as I in childhood sweetly slept:Untroubling and untroubled where I lie; The grass below- above the vaulted sky. 
                        

                        HAD I the heavens' embroidered cloths,Enwrought with golden and silver light,The blue and the dim and the dark clothsOf night and light and the half-light,I would spread the cloths under your feet:But I, being poor, have only my dreams;I have spread my dreams under your feet;Tread softly because you tread on my dreams. 
                        

                        One Christmas was so much like another, in those years around the sea-town corner now and out of all sound except the distant speaking of the voices I sometimes hear a moment before sleep, that I can never remember whether it snowed for six days and six nights when I was twelve or whether it snowed for twelve days and twelve nights when I was six.All the Christmases roll down toward the two-tongued sea, like a cold and headlong moon bundling down the sky that was our street; and they stop at the rim of the ice-edged fish-freezing waves, and I plunge my hands in the snow and bring out whatever I can find. In goes my hand into that wool-white bell-tongued ball of holidays resting at the rim of the carol-singing sea, and out come Mrs. Prothero and the firemen.It was on the afternoon of the Christmas Eve, and I was in Mrs. Prothero's garden, waiting for cats, with her son Jim. It was snowing. It was always snowing at Christmas. December, in my memory, is white as Lapland, though there were no reindeers. But there were cats. Patient, cold and callous, our hands wrapped in socks, we waited to snowball the cats. Sleek and long as jaguars and horrible-whiskered, spitting and snarling, they would slink and sidle over the white back-garden walls, and the lynx-eyed hunters, Jim and I, fur-capped and moccasined trappers from Hudson Bay, off Mumbles Road, would hurl our deadly snowballs at the green of their eyes. The wise cats never appeared.We were so still, Eskimo-footed arctic marksmen in the muffling silence of the eternal snows - eternal, ever since Wednesday - that we never heard Mrs. Prothero's first cry from her igloo at the bottom of the garden. Or, if we heard it at all, it was, to us, like the far-off challenge of our enemy and prey, the neighbor's polar cat. But soon the voice grew louder."Fire!" cried Mrs. Prothero, and she beat the dinner-gong.And we ran down the garden, with the snowballs in our arms, toward the house; and smoke, indeed, was pouring out of the dining-room, and the gong was bombilating, and Mrs. Prothero was announcing ruin like a town crier in Pompeii. This was better than all the cats in Wales standing on the wall in a row. We bounded into the house, laden with snowballs, and stopped at the open door of the smoke-filled room.Something was burning all right; perhaps it was Mr. Prothero, who always slept there after midday dinner with a newspaper over his face. But he was standing in the middle of the room, saying, "A fine Christmas!" and smacking at the smoke with a slipper."Call the fire brigade," cried Mrs. Prothero as she beat the gong."There won't be there," said Mr. Prothero, "it's Christmas."There was no fire to be seen, only clouds of smoke and Mr. Prothero standing in the middle of them, waving his slipper as though he were conducting."Do something," he said. And we threw all our snowballs into the smoke - I think we missed Mr. Prothero - and ran out of the house to the telephone box."Let's call the police as well," Jim said. "And the ambulance." "And Ernie Jenkins, he likes fires."But we only called the fire brigade, and soon the fire engine came and three tall men in helmets brought a hose into the house and Mr. Prothero got out just in time before they turned it on. Nobody could have had a noisier Christmas Eve. And when the firemen turned off the hose and were standing in the wet, smoky room, Jim's Aunt, Miss. Prothero, came downstairs and peered in at them. Jim and I waited, very quietly, to hear what she would say to them. She said the right thing, always. She looked at the three tall firemen in their shining helmets, standing among the smoke and cinders and dissolving snowballs, and she said, "Would you like anything to read?"Years and years ago, when I was a boy, when there were wolves in Wales, and birds the color of red-flannel petticoats whisked past the harp-shaped hills, when we sang and wallowed all night and day in caves that smelt like Sunday afternoons in damp front farmhouse parlors, and we chased, with the jawbones of deacons, the English and the bears, before the motor car, before the wheel, before the duchess-faced horse, when we rode the daft and happy hills bareback, it snowed and it snowed. But here a small boy says: "It snowed last year, too. I made a snowman and my brother knocked it down and I knocked my brother down and then we had tea.""But that was not the same snow," I say. "Our snow was not only shaken from white wash buckets down the sky, it came shawling out of the ground and swam and drifted out of the arms and hands and bodies of the trees; snow grew overnight on the roofs of the houses like a pure and grandfather moss, minutely -ivied the walls and settled on the postman, opening the gate, like a dumb, numb thunder-storm of white, torn Christmas cards.""Were there postmen then, too?""With sprinkling eyes and wind-cherried noses, on spread, frozen feet they crunched up to the doors and mittened on them manfully. But all that the children could hear was a ringing of bells.""You mean that the postman went rat-a-tat-tat and the doors rang?""I mean that the bells the children could hear were inside them.""I only hear thunder sometimes, never bells.""There were church bells, too.""Inside them?""No, no, no, in the bat-black, snow-white belfries, tugged by bishops and storks. And they rang their tidings over the bandaged town, over the frozen foam of the powder and ice-cream hills, over the crackling sea. It seemed that all the churches boomed for joy under my window; and the weathercocks crew for Christmas, on our fence.""Get back to the postmen""They were just ordinary postmen, found of walking and dogs and Christmas and the snow. They knocked on the doors with blue knuckles ....""Ours has got a black knocker....""And then they stood on the white Welcome mat in the little, drifted porches and huffed and puffed, making ghosts with their breath, and jogged from foot to foot like small boys wanting to go out.""And then the presents?""And then the Presents, after the Christmas box. And the cold postman, with a rose on his button-nose, tingled down the tea-tray-slithered run of the chilly glinting hill. He went in his ice-bound boots like a man on fishmonger's slabs. "He wagged his bag like a frozen camel's hump, dizzily turned the corner on one foot, and, by God, he was gone.""Get back to the Presents.""There were the Useful Presents: engulfing mufflers of the old coach days, and mittens made for giant sloths; zebra scarfs of a substance like silky gum that could be tug-o'-warred down to the galoshes; blinding tam-o'-shanters like patchwork tea cozies and bunny-suited busbies and balaclavas for victims of head-shrinking tribes; from aunts who always wore wool next to the skin there were mustached and rasping vests that made you wonder why the aunts had any skin left at all; and once I had a little crocheted nose bag from an aunt now, alas, no longer whinnying with us. And pictureless books in which small boys, though warned with quotations not to, would skate on Farmer Giles' pond and did and drowned; and books that told me everything about the wasp, except why.""Go on the Useless Presents.""Bags of moist and many-colored jelly babies and a folded flag and a false nose and a tram-conductor's cap and a machine that punched tickets and rang a bell; never a catapult; once, by mistake that no one could explain, a little hatchet; and a celluloid duck that made, when you pressed it, a most unducklike sound, a mewing moo that an ambitious cat might make who wished to be a cow; and a painting book in which I could make the grass, the trees, the sea and the animals any colour I pleased, and still the dazzling sky-blue sheep are grazing in the red field under the rainbow-billed and pea-green birds. Hardboileds, toffee, fudge and allsorts, crunches, cracknels, humbugs, glaciers, marzipan, and butterwelsh for the Welsh. And troops of bright tin soldiers who, if they could not fight, could always run. And Snakes-and-Families and Happy Ladders. And Easy Hobbi-Games for Little Engineers, complete with instructions. Oh, easy for Leonardo! And a whistle to make the dogs bark to wake up the old man next door to make him beat on the wall with his stick to shake our picture off the wall. And a packet of cigarettes: you put one in your mouth and you stood at the corner of the street and you waited for hours, in vain, for an old lady to scold you for smoking a cigarette, and then with a smirk you ate it. And then it was breakfast under the balloons.""Were there Uncles like in our house?""There are always Uncles at Christmas. The same Uncles. And on Christmas morning, with dog-disturbing whistle and sugar fags, I would scour the swatched town for the news of the little world, and find always a dead bird by the Post Office or by the white deserted swings; perhaps a robin, all but one of his fires out. Men and women wading or scooping back from chapel, with taproom noses and wind-bussed cheeks, all albinos, huddles their stiff black jarring feathers against the irreligious snow. Mistletoe hung from the gas brackets in all the front parlors; there was sherry and walnuts and bottled beer and crackers by the dessertspoons; and cats in their fur-abouts watched the fires; and the high-heaped fire spat, all ready for the chestnuts and the mulling pokers. Some few large men sat in the front parlors, without their collars, Uncles almost certainly, trying their new cigars, holding them out judiciously at arms' length, returning them to their mouths, coughing, then holding them out again as though waiting for the explosion; and some few small aunts, not wanted in the kitchen, nor anywhere else for that matter, sat on the very edge of their chairs, poised and brittle, afraid to break, like faded cups and saucers."Not many those mornings trod the piling streets: an old man always, fawn-bowlered, yellow-gloved and, at this time of year, with spats of snow, would take his constitutional to the white bowling green and back, as he would take it wet or fire on Christmas Day or Doomsday; sometimes two hale young men, with big pipes blazing, no overcoats and wind blown scarfs, would trudge, unspeaking, down to the forlorn sea, to work up an appetite, to blow away the fumes, who knows, to walk into the waves until nothing of them was left but the two furling smoke clouds of their inextinguishable briars. Then I would be slap-dashing home, the gravy smell of the dinners of others, the bird smell, the brandy, the pudding and mince, coiling up to my nostrils, when out of a snow-clogged side lane would come a boy the spit of myself, with a pink-tipped cigarette and the violet past of a black eye, cocky as a bullfinch, leering all to himself.I hated him on sight and sound, and would be about to put my dog whistle to my lips and blow him off the face of Christmas when suddenly he, with a violet wink, put his whistle to his lips and blew so stridently, so high, so exquisitely loud, that gobbling faces, their cheeks bulged with goose, would press against their tinsled windows, the whole length of the white echoing street. For dinner we had turkey and blazing pudding, and after dinner the Uncles sat in front of the fire, loosened all buttons, put their large moist hands over their watch chains, groaned a little and slept. Mothers, aunts and sisters scuttled to and fro, bearing tureens. Auntie Bessie, who had already been frightened, twice, by a clock-work mouse, whimpered at the sideboard and had some elderberry wine. The dog was sick. Auntie Dosie had to have three aspirins, but Auntie Hannah, who liked port, stood in the middle of the snowbound back yard, singing like a big-bosomed thrush. I would blow up balloons to see how big they would blow up to; and, when they burst, which they all did, the Uncles jumped and rumbled. In the rich and heavy afternoon, the Uncles breathing like dolphins and the snow descending, I would sit among festoons and Chinese lanterns and nibble dates and try to make a model man-o'-war, following the Instructions for Little Engineers, and produce what might be mistaken for a sea-going tramcar.Or I would go out, my bright new boots squeaking, into the white world, on to the seaward hill, to call on Jim and Dan and Jack and to pad through the still streets, leaving huge footprints on the hidden pavements."I bet people will think there's been hippos.""What would you do if you saw a hippo coming down our street?""I'd go like this, bang! I'd throw him over the railings and roll him down the hill and then I'd tickle him under the ear and he'd wag his tail.""What would you do if you saw two hippos?"Iron-flanked and bellowing he-hippos clanked and battered through the scudding snow toward us as we passed Mr. Daniel's house."Let's post Mr. Daniel a snow-ball through his letter box.""Let's write things in the snow.""Let's write, 'Mr. Daniel looks like a spaniel' all over his lawn."Or we walked on the white shore. "Can the fishes see it's snowing?"The silent one-clouded heavens drifted on to the sea. Now we were snow-blind travelers lost on the north hills, and vast dewlapped dogs, with flasks round their necks, ambled and shambled up to us, baying "Excelsior." We returned home through the poor streets where only a few children fumbled with bare red fingers in the wheel-rutted snow and cat-called after us, their voices fading away, as we trudged uphill, into the cries of the dock birds and the hooting of ships out in the whirling bay. And then, at tea the recovered Uncles would be jolly; and the ice cake loomed in the center of the table like a marble grave. Auntie Hannah laced her tea with rum, because it was only once a year.Bring out the tall tales now that we told by the fire as the gaslight bubbled like a diver. Ghosts whooed like owls in the long nights when I dared not look over my shoulder; animals lurked in the cubbyhole under the stairs and the gas meter ticked. And I remember that we went singing carols once, when there wasn't the shaving of a moon to light the flying streets. At the end of a long road was a drive that led to a large house, and we stumbled up the darkness of the drive that night, each one of us afraid, each one holding a stone in his hand in case, and all of us too brave to say a word. The wind through the trees made noises as of old and unpleasant and maybe webfooted men wheezing in caves. We reached the black bulk of the house. "What shall we give them? Hark the Herald?""No," Jack said, "Good King Wencelas. I'll count three." One, two three, and we began to sing, our voices high and seemingly distant in the snow-felted darkness round the house that was occupied by nobody we knew. We stood close together, near the dark door. Good King Wencelas looked out On the Feast of Stephen ... And then a small, dry voice, like the voice of someone who has not spoken for a long time, joined our singing: a small, dry, eggshell voice from the other side of the door: a small dry voice through the keyhole. And when we stopped running we were outside our house; the front room was lovely; balloons floated under the hot-water-bottle-gulping gas; everything was good again and shone over the town."Perhaps it was a ghost," Jim said. "Perhaps it was trolls," Dan said, who was always reading."Let's go in and see if there's any jelly left," Jack said. And we did that.Always on Christmas night there was music. An uncle played the fiddle, a cousin sang "Cherry Ripe," and another uncle sang "Drake's Drum." It was very warm in the little house. Auntie Hannah, who had got on to the parsnip wine, sang a song about Bleeding Hearts and Death, and then another in which she said her heart was like a Bird's Nest; and then everybody laughed again; and then I went to bed. Looking through my bedroom window, out into the moonlight and the unending smoke-colored snow, I could see the lights in the windows of all the other houses on our hill and hear the music rising from them up the long, steady falling night. I turned the gas down, I got into bed. I said some words to the close and holy darkness, and then I slept. 
                        

                        «Let this fluffy snow fall upon ourDreams and make them shine! »Set free, Your breath smoothens unshaken skies; Your perception scratches unopened realities.Is it a diversion -maybe- for lost thoughts, For lost faces and sins? Looking the other way out of fear or Embarrassment, waking up next morning, You should then learnHow to keep alive the drowsing mind, While trying to shove awayHer plait of hair, Jammed in the eyes of memory.Ah.. Those haunting memories! Was her pain realWhen she asserted  «That one is my spoiled dress! My party dressWhich your eyes, filled with lust, tore off of me..»? Hardly a twist of fate thatMultivalent perception which madeVisionary  —FancifulYour unnecessary waiting.Because she didn't come back.Even at dawn. Even in your expectation.Now your pain screams only through silenceWhen you sink your fingers deepInto your bleeding heart  —A sheer griefWith no voice anymoreBecause day in day out, year after yearEverything becomes habit.Until, Gazing at the fluffy snow falling, youCaught a glimpse of her  —Along with aWhiff of her perfume..Peering deeply into your eyesShe spoke words of hopeAlong with a promise -possibly-: « A new life is looming beyond the whitenedFields of your mind »Hushed words, uttered under her breath, Not to scrape the purity of the night.Was it a prophecy?

                        I knew a simple soldier boyWho grinned at life in empty joy,Slept soundly through the lonesome dark,And whistled early with the lark.In winter trenches, cowed and glum,With crumps and lice and lack of rum,He put a bullet through his brain.No one spoke of him again.You smug-faced crowds with kindling eyeWho cheer when soldier lads march by,Sneak home and pray you'll never knowThe hell where youth and laughter go.

                        The sea is calm to-night.The tide is full, the moon lies fairUpon the straits; - on the French coast the lightGleams and is gone; the cliffs of England stand,Glimmering and vast, out in the tranquil bay.Come to the window, sweet is the night-air! Only, from the long line of sprayWhere the sea meets the moon-blanch'd land,Listen! you hear the grating roarOf pebbles which the waves draw back, and fling,At their return, up the high strand,Begin, and cease, and then again begin,With tremulous cadence slow, and bringThe eternal note of sadness in.Sophocles long agoHeard it on the {AE}gean, and it broughtInto his mind the turbid ebb and flowOf human misery; weFind also in the sound a thought,Hearing it by this distant northern sea.The Sea of FaithWas once, too, at the full, and round earth's shoreLay like the folds of a bright girdle furl'd.But now I only hearIts melancholy, long, withdrawing roar,Retreating, to the breathOf the night-wind, down the vast edges drearAnd naked shingles of the world.Ah, love, let us be trueTo one another! for the world, which seemsTo lie before us like a land of dreams,So various, so beautiful, so new,Hath really neither joy, nor love, nor light,Nor certitude, nor peace, nor help for pain; And we are here as on a darkling plainSwept with confused alarms of struggle and flight,Where ignorant armies clash by night. 
                        

                        Abou Ben Adhem (may his tribe increase!)Awoke one night from a deep dream of peace,And saw, within the moonlight in his room,Making it rich, and like a lily in bloom,An angel writing in a book of gold:— Exceeding peace had made Ben Adhem bold,And to the Presence in the room he said"What writest thou?"—The vision raised its head,And with a look made of all sweet accord,Answered "The names of those who love the Lord.""And is mine one?" said Abou. "Nay, not so,"Replied the angel. Abou spoke more low,But cheerly still, and said "I pray thee, then,Write me as one that loves his fellow men."The angel wrote, and vanished. The next nightIt came again with a great wakening light,And showed the names whom love of God had blessed,And lo! Ben Adhem's name led all the rest.Anonymous Submission 
                        

                        What is this life if, full of care,We have no time to stand and stare.No time to stand beneath the boughsAnd stare as long as sheep or cows.No time to see, when woods we pass,Where squirrels hide their nuts in grass.No time to see, in broad daylight,Streams full of stars, like skies at night.No time to turn at Beauty's glance,And watch her feet, how they can dance.No time to wait till her mouth canEnrich that smile her eyes began.A poor life this is if, full of care,We have no time to stand and stare. 
                        

                        Sweet moment, stay with me, and pray do not flee so soon, Let me enjoy the bliss of thatfirst kiss beneath the moon.I wish to cradle this feeling, that has only just been found, A feeling that has unexpectedlyturned my world around.Do not depart, Oh please remainwithin my heart awhile, So that I can savour you once more, and hold you in my smile. 
                        

                        The moment when, after many yearsof hard work and a long voyageyou stand in the centre of your room,house, half-acre, square mile, island, country,knowing at last how you got there,and say, I own this,is the same moment when the trees unloosetheir soft arms from around you,the birds take back their language,the cliffs fissure and collapse,the air moves back from you like a waveand you can't breathe.No, they whisper. You own nothing.You were a visitor, time after timeclimbing the hill, planting the flag, proclaiming.We never belonged to you.You never found us.It was always the other way round. 
                        

                        All you who sleep tonightFar from the ones you love,No hand to left or rightAnd emptiness above -Know that you aren't aloneThe whole world shares your tears,Some for two nights or one,And some for all their years. 
                        

                        I think awhile of Love, and while I think, Love is to me a world, Sole meat and sweetest drink, And close connecting link Tween heaven and earth. I only know it is, not how or why, My greatest happiness; However hard I try, Not if I were to die, Can I explain. I fain would ask my friend how it can be, But when the time arrives, Then Love is more lovely Than anything to me, And so I'm dumb. For if the truth were known, Love cannot speak, But only thinks and does; Though surely out 'twill leak Without the help of Greek, Or any tongue. A man may love the truth and practise it, Beauty he may admire, And goodness not omit, As much as may befit To reverence. But only when these three together meet, As they always incline, And make one soul the seat, And favorite retreat, Of loveliness; When under kindred shape, like loves and hates And a kindred nature, Proclaim us to be mates, Exposed to equal fates Eternally; And each may other help, and service do, Drawing Love's bands more tight, Service he ne'er shall rue While one and one make two, And two are one; In such case only doth man fully prove Fully as man can do, What power there is in Love His inmost soul to move Resistlessly. ______ Two sturdy oaks I mean, which side by side, Withstand the winter's storm, And spite of wind and tide, Grow up the meadow's pride, For both are strong Above they barely touch, but undermined Down to their deepest source, Admiring you shall find Their roots are intertwined Insep'rably. 
                        

                        Once, when I was young and true,  Someone left me sad-Broke my brittle heart in two;  And that is very bad.Love is for unlucky folk,  Love is but a curse.Once there was a heart I broke;  And that, I think, is worse. 
                        

                        Once riding in old Baltimore,    Heart-filled, head-filled with glee,I saw a Baltimorean    Keep looking straight at me.Now I was eight and very small,    And he was no whit bigger,And so I smiled, but he poked out    His tongue, and called me, 'Nigger.'I saw the whole of Baltimore    From May until December;Of all the things that happened there    That's all that I remember. 
                        

                        'Help, help, ' said a man. 'I'm drowning.''Hang on, ' said a man from the shore.'Help, help, ' said the man. 'I'm not clowning.''Yes, I know, I heard you before.Be patient dear man who is drowning, You, see I've got a disease.I'm waiting for a Doctor J. Browning.So do be patient please.''How long, ' said the man who was drowning. 'Will it take for the Doc to arrive? ''Not very long, ' said the man with the disease. 'Till then try staying alive.''Very well, ' said the man who was drowning. 'I'll try and stay afloat.By reciting the poems of BrowningAnd other things he wrote.''Help, help, ' said the man with the disease, 'I suddenly feel quite ill.''Keep calm.' said the man who was drowning, ' Breathe deeply and lie quite still.''Oh dear, ' said the man with the awful disease. 'I think I'm going to die.''Farewell, ' said the man who was drowning.Said the man with the disease, 'goodbye.'So the man who was drowning, drowndedAnd the man with the disease past away.But apart from that, And a fire in my flat, It's been a very nice day. 
                        

                        Slowly, silently, now the moonWalks the night in her silver shoon;This way, and that, she peers, and seesSilver fruit upon silver trees;One by one the casements catchHer beams beneath the silvery thatch;Couched in his kennel, like a log,With paws of silver sleeps the dog;From their shadowy cote the white breasts peepOf doves in silver feathered sleepA harvest mouse goes scampering by,With silver claws, and silver eye;And moveless fish in the water gleam,By silver reeds in a silver stream. 
                        

                        As soon as Fred gets out of bed,his underwear goes on his head.His mother laughs, "Don't put it there,a head's no place for underwear!"But near his ears, above his brains,is where Fred's underwear remains.At night when Fred goes back to bed,he deftly plucks it off his head.His mother switches off the lightand softly croons, "Good night! Good night!"And then, for reasons no one knows,Fred's underwear goes on his toes. 
                        

                        When I have fears that I may cease to be          Before my pen has glean'd my teeming brain,     Before high-piled books, in charactery,         Hold like rich garners the full ripen'd grain;      When I behold, upon the night's starr'd face,         Huge cloudy symbols of a high romance,     And think that I may never live to trace         Their shadows, with the magic hand of chance;      And when I feel, fair creature of an hour,         That I shall never look upon thee more,     Never have relish in the faery power         Of unreflecting love; - then on the shore     Of the wide world I stand alone, and think     Till love and fame to nothingness do sink. 
                        

                        Lie down lass, with me, in sage green meadowsYour blouse flouncing open, in the teasing breezeThe meadows, feel so cotton, this time of yearCome lay beside me, and sense my desires.Open field, honeysuckle....arouses my yen  For passion 'neath th' sparkle by th' mid-noon sun No clouds abide our scape of choice to pleasureSo, again I ask you lass, come lay beside me.Come close, love, as these hungry emerald eyesBeg to stare into your warm, black diamond eyesTake my hand in bond, I assure you, my lov',     That emeralds and diamonds never fade away.

                        In Flanders fields the poppies blowBetween the crosses, row on row,That mark our place; and in the skyThe larks, still bravely singing, flyScarce heard amid the guns below.We are the Dead. Short days agoWe lived, felt dawn, saw sunset glow,Loved and were loved, and now we lie,In Flanders fields.Take up our quarrel with the foe:To you from failing hands we throwThe torch; be yours to hold it high.If ye break faith with us who dieWe shall not sleep, though poppies growIn Flanders fields. 
                        

                        In Xanadu did Kubla KhanA stately pleasure-dome decree :Where Alph, the sacred river, ranThrough caverns measureless to man     Down to a sunless sea.So twice five miles of fertile groundWith walls and towers were girdled round :And there were gardens bright with sinuous rills,Where blossomed many an incense-bearing tree ;And here were forests ancient as the hills,Enfolding sunny spots of greenery.But oh ! that deep romantic chasm which slantedDown the green hill athwart a cedarn cover !A savage place ! as holy and enchantedAs e'er beneath a waning moon was hauntedBy woman wailing for her demon-lover !And from this chasm, with ceaseless turmoil seething,As if this earth in fast thick pants were breathing,A mighty fountain momently was forced :Amid whose swift half-intermitted burstHuge fragments vaulted like rebounding hail,Or chaffy grain beneath the thresher's flail :And 'mid these dancing rocks at once and everIt flung up momently the sacred river.Five miles meandering with a mazy motionThrough wood and dale the sacred river ran,Then reached the caverns measureless to man,And sank in tumult to a lifeless ocean :And 'mid this tumult Kubla heard from farAncestral voices prophesying war !     The shadow of the dome of pleasure     Floated midway on the waves ;     Where was heard the mingled measure     From the fountain and the caves.It was a miracle of rare device,A sunny pleasure-dome with caves of ice !     A damsel with a dulcimer     In a vision once I saw :     It was an Abyssinian maid,     And on her dulcimer she played,     Singing of Mount Abora.     Could I revive within me     Her symphony and song,     To such a deep delight 'twould win me,That with music loud and long,I would build that dome in air,That sunny dome ! those caves of ice !And all who heard should see them there,And all should cry, Beware ! Beware !His flashing eyes, his floating hair !Weave a circle round him thrice,And close your eyes with holy dread,For he on honey-dew hath fed,And drunk the milk of Paradise. 
                        

                        To keep your marriage brimmingWith love in the loving cup,Whenever you’re wrong, admit it; Whenever you’re right, shut up. 
                        

                        Your pain is the breaking of the shell that encloses your understanding. Even as the stone of the fruit must break, that its heart may stand in the sun, so must you know pain. And could you keep your heart in wonder at the daily miracles of your life, your pain would not seem less wondrous than your joy; And you would accept the seasons of your heart, even as you have always accepted the seasons that pass over your fields. And you would watch with serenity through the winters of your grief. Much of your pain is self-chosen. It is the bitter potion by which the physician within you heals your sick self. Therefore trust the physician, and drink his remedy in silence and tranquillity: For his hand, though heavy and hard, is guided by the tender hand of the Unseen, And the cup he brings, though it burn your lips, has been fashioned of the clay which the Potter has moistened with His own sacred tears. 
                        

                        Praise the spells and bless the charms,I found April in my arms.April golden, April cloudy,Gracious, cruel, tender, rowdy;April soft in flowered languor,April cold with sudden anger,Ever changing, ever true --I love April, I love you. 
                        

                        I caught a tremendous fishand held him beside the boathalf out of water, with my hookfast in a corner of his mouth.He didn't fight.He hadn't fought at all.He hung a grunting weight,battered and venerableand homely. Here and therehis brown skin hung in stripslike ancient wallpaper,and its pattern of darker brownwas like wallpaper:shapes like full-blown rosesstained and lost through age.He was speckled with barnacles,fine rosettes of lime,and infestedwith tiny white sea-lice,and underneath two or threerags of green weed hung down.While his gills were breathing inthe terrible oxygen- the frightening gills,fresh and crisp with blood,that can cut so badly- I thought of the coarse white fleshpacked in like feathers,the big bones and the little bones,the dramatic reds and blacksof his shiny entrails,and the pink swim-bladderlike a big peony.I looked into his eyeswhich were far larger than minebut shallower, and yellowed,the irises backed and packedwith tarnished tinfoilseen through the lensesof old scratched isinglass.They shifted a little, but notto return my stare.- It was more like the tippingof an object toward the light.I admired his sullen face,the mechanism of his jaw,and then I sawthat from his lower lip- if you could call it a lipgrim, wet, and weaponlike,hung five old pieces of fish-line,or four and a wire leaderwith the swivel still attached,with all their five big hooksgrown firmly in his mouth.A green line, frayed at the endwhere he broke it, two heavier lines,and a fine black threadstill crimped from the strain and snapwhen it broke and he got away.Like medals with their ribbonsfrayed and wavering,a five-haired beard of wisdomtrailing from his aching jaw.I stared and staredand victory filled upthe little rented boat,from the pool of bilgewhere oil had spread a rainbowaround the rusted engineto the bailer rusted orange,the sun-cracked thwarts,the oarlocks on their strings,the gunnels- until everythingwas rainbow, rainbow, rainbow! And I let the fish go. 
                        

                        What passing-bells for these who die as cattle? Only the monstrous anger of the guns. Only the stuttering rifles' rapid rattle Can patter out their hasty orisons. No mockeries now for them; no prayers nor bells; Nor any voice of mourning save the choirs, The shrill, demented choirs of wailing shells; And bugles calling for them from sad shires. What candles may be held to speed them all? Not in the hands of boys, but in their eyes Shall shine the holy glimmers of good-byes. The pallor of girls' brows shall be their pall; Their flowers the tenderness of patient minds, And each slow dusk a drawing-down of blinds. 
                        

                        Where are you, my beloved? Are you in that little Paradise, watering the flowers who look upon you As infants look upon the breast of their mothers? Or are you in your chamber where the shrine of Virtue has been placed in your honor, and upon Which you offer my heart and soul as sacrifice? Or amongst the books, seeking human knowledge, While you are replete with heavenly wisdom? Oh companion of my soul, where are you? Are you Praying in the temple? Or calling Nature in the Field, haven of your dreams? Are you in the huts of the poor, consoling the Broken-hearted with the sweetness of your soul, and Filling their hands with your bounty? You are God's spirit everywhere; You are stronger than the ages. Do you have memory of the day we met, when the halo of You spirit surrounded us, and the Angels of Love Floated about, singing the praise of the soul's deed? Do you recollect our sitting in the shade of the Branches, sheltering ourselves from Humanity, as the ribs Protect the divine secret of the heart from injury? Remember you the trails and forest we walked, with hands Joined, and our heads leaning against each other, as if We were hiding ourselves within ourselves? Recall you the hour I bade you farewell, And the Maritime kiss you placed on my lips? That kiss taught me that joining of lips in Love Reveals heavenly secrets which the tongue cannot utter! That kiss was introduction to a great sigh, Like the Almighty's breath that turned earth into man. That sigh led my way into the spiritual world, Announcing the glory of my soul; and there It shall perpetuate until again we meet. I remember when you kissed me and kissed me, With tears coursing your cheeks, and you said, "Earthly bodies must often separate for earthly purpose, And must live apart impelled by worldly intent. "But the spirit remains joined safely in the hands of Love, until death arrives and takes joined souls to God. "Go, my beloved; Love has chosen you her delegate; Over her, for she is Beauty who offers to her follower The cup of the sweetness of life. As for my own empty arms, your love shall remain my Comforting groom; you memory, my Eternal wedding." Where are you now, my other self? Are you awake in The silence of the night? Let the clean breeze convey To you my heart's every beat and affection. Are you fondling my face in your memory? That image Is no longer my own, for Sorrow has dropped his Shadow on my happy countenance of the past. Sobs have withered my eyes which reflected your beauty And dried my lips which you sweetened with kisses. Where are you, my beloved? Do you hear my weeping From beyond the ocean? Do you understand my need? Do you know the greatness of my patience? Is there any spirit in the air capable of conveying To you the breath of this dying youth? Is there any Secret communication between angels that will carry to You my complaint? Where are you, my beautiful star? The obscurity of life Has cast me upon its bosom; sorrow has conquered me. Sail your smile into the air; it will reach and enliven me! Breathe your fragrance into the air; it will sustain me! Where are you, me beloved? Oh, how great is Love! And how little am I! 
                        

                        I ne'er was struck before that hour With love so sudden and so sweet, Her face it bloomed like a sweet flower And stole my heart away complete. My face turned pale as deadly pale. My legs refused to walk away, And when she looked, what could I ail? My life and all seemed turned to clay.And then my blood rushed to my face And took my eyesight quite away, The trees and bushes round the place Seemed midnight at noonday. I could not see a single thing, Words from my eyes did start -- They spoke as chords do from the string, And blood burnt round my heart.Are flowers the winter's choice? Is love's bed always snow? She seemed to hear my silent voice, Not love's appeals to know. I never saw so sweet a face As that I stood before. My heart has left its dwelling-place And can return no more 
                        

                        There are strange things done in the midnight sun    By the men who moil for gold;The Arctic trails have their secret tales    That would make your blood run cold;The Northern Lights have seen queer sights,    But the queerest they ever did seeWas that night on the marge of Lake Lebarge    I cremated Sam McGee.Now Sam McGee was from Tennessee, where the cotton blooms and blows.Why he left his home in the South to roam 'round the Pole, God only knows.He was always cold, but the land of gold seemed to hold him like a spell;Though he'd often say in his homely way that he'd "sooner live in hell".On a Christmas Day we were mushing our way over the Dawson trail.Talk of your cold! through the parka's fold it stabbed like a driven nail.If our eyes we'd close, then the lashes froze till sometimes we couldn't see;It wasn't much fun, but the only one to whimper was Sam McGee.And that very night, as we lay packed tight in our robes beneath the snow,And the dogs were fed, and the stars o'erhead were dancing heel and toe,He turned to me, and "Cap," says he, "I'll cash in this trip, I guess;And if I do, I'm asking that you won't refuse my last request."Well, he seemed so low that I couldn't say no; then he says with a sort of moan:"It's the cursed cold, and it's got right hold till I'm chilled clean through to the bone.Yet 'tain't being dead -- it's my awful dread of the icy grave that pains;So I want you to swear that, foul or fair, you'll cremate my last remains."A pal's last need is a thing to heed, so I swore I would not fail;And we started on at the streak of dawn; but God! he looked ghastly pale.He crouched on the sleigh, and he raved all day of his home in Tennessee;And before nightfall a corpse was all that was left of Sam McGee.There wasn't a breath in that land of death, and I hurried, horror-driven,With a corpse half hid that I couldn't get rid, because of a promise given;It was lashed to the sleigh, and it seemed to say:"You may tax your brawn and brains,But you promised true, and it's up to you to cremate those last remains."Now a promise made is a debt unpaid, and the trail has its own stern code.In the days to come, though my lips were dumb, in my heart how I cursed that load.In the long, long night, by the lone firelight, while the huskies, round in a ring,Howled out their woes to the homeless snows -- O God! how I loathed the thing.And every day that quiet clay seemed to heavy and heavier grow;And on I went, though the dogs were spent and the grub was getting low;The trail was bad, and I felt half mad, but I swore I would not give in;And I'd often sing to the hateful thing, and it hearkened with a grin.Till I came to the marge of Lake Lebarge, and a derelict there lay;It was jammed in the ice, but I saw in a trice it was called the "Alice May".And I looked at it, and I thought a bit, and I looked at my frozen chum;Then "Here," said I, with a sudden cry, "is my cre-ma-tor-eum."Some planks I tore from the cabin floor, and I lit the boiler fire;Some coal I found that was lying around, and I heaped the fuel higher;The flames just soared, and the furnace roared -- such a blaze you seldom see;And I burrowed a hole in the glowing coal, and I stuffed in Sam McGee.Then I made a hike, for I didn't like to hear him sizzle so;And the heavens scowled, and the huskies howled, and the wind began to blow.It was icy cold, but the hot sweat rolled down my cheeks, and I don't know why;And the greasy smoke in an inky cloak went streaking down the sky.I do not know how long in the snow I wrestled with grisly fear;But the stars came out and they danced about ere again I ventured near;I was sick with dread, but I bravely said: "I'll just take a peep inside.I guess he's cooked, and it's time I looked"; . . . then the door I opened wide.And there sat Sam, looking cool and calm, in the heart of the furnace roar;And he wore a smile you could see a mile, and he said: "Please close that door.It's fine in here, but I greatly fear you'll let in the cold and storm --Since I left Plumtree, down in Tennessee, it's the first time I've been warm."There are strange things done in the midnight sun    By the men who moil for gold;The Arctic trails have their secret tales    That would make your blood run cold;The Northern Lights have seen queer sights,    But the queerest they ever did seeWas that night on the marge of Lake Lebarge    I cremated Sam McGee. 
                        

                        If I should die, think only this of me:That there's some corner of a foreign fieldThat is for ever England. There shall beIn that rich earth a richer dust concealed;A dust whom England bore, shaped, made aware,Gave, once, her flowers to love, her ways to roam,A body of England's, breathing English air,Washed by the rivers, blest by suns of home.And think, this heart, all evil shed away,A pulse in the eternal mind, no lessGives somewhere back the thoughts by England given;Her sights and sounds; dreams happy as her day;And laughter, learnt of friends; and gentleness,In hearts at peace, under an English heaven. 
                        

                        A child said, What is the grass? fetching it to me with full	hands;How could I answer the child?. . . .I do not know what it	is any more than he.I guess it must be the flag of my disposition, out of hopeful	green stuff woven.Or I guess it is the handkerchief of the Lord,A scented gift and remembrancer designedly dropped,Bearing the owner's name someway in the corners, that we	may see and remark, and say Whose?Or I guess the grass is itself a child. . . .the produced babe	of the vegetation.Or I guess it is a uniform hieroglyphic,And it means, Sprouting alike in broad zones and narrow	zones,Growing among black folks as among white,Kanuck, Tuckahoe, Congressman, Cuff, I give them the same, I receive them the same.And now it seems to me the beautiful uncut hair of graves.Tenderly will I use you curling grass,It may be you transpire from the breasts of young men,It may be if I had known them I would have loved them;It may be you are from old people and from women, and	from offspring taken soon out of their mother's laps,And here you are the mother's laps.This grass is very dark to be from the white heads of old	mothers,Darker than the colorless beards of old men,Dark to come from under the faint red roofs of mouths.O I perceive after all so many uttering tongues!And I perceive they do not come from the roofs of mouths	for nothing.I wish I could translate the hints about the dead young men	and women,And the hints about old men and mothers, and the offspring	taken soon out of their laps.What do you think has become of the young and old men?What do you think has become of the women and	children?They are alive and well somewhere;The smallest sprouts show there is really no death,And if ever there was it led forward life, and does not wait	at the end to arrest it,And ceased the moment life appeared.All goes onward and outward. . . .and nothing collapses,And to die is different from what any one supposed, and	luckier. 
                        

                        Expect nothing. Live frugallyOn surprise.become a strangerTo need of pityOr, if compassion be freelyGiven outTake only enoughStop short of urge to pleadThen purge away the need.Wish for nothing largerThan your own small heartOr greater than a star; Tame wild disappointmentWith caress unmoved and coldMake of it a parkaFor your soul.Discover the reason whySo tiny human midgetExists at allSo scared unwiseBut expect nothing. Live frugallyOn surprise. 
                        

                        Abortions will not let you forget.You remember the children you got that you did not get,The damp small pulps with a little or with no hair,The singers and workers that never handled the air.You will never neglect or beatThem, or silence or buy with a sweet.You will never wind up the sucking-thumbOr scuttle off ghosts that come.You will never leave them, controlling your luscious sigh,Return for a snack of them, with gobbling mother-eye.I have heard in the voices of the wind the voices of my dim killed	children.I have contracted. I have easedMy dim dears at the breasts they could never suck.I have said, Sweets, if I sinned, if I seizedYour luckAnd your lives from your unfinished reach,If I stole your births and your names,Your straight baby tears and your games,Your stilted or lovely loves, your tumults, your marriages, aches,	and your deaths,If I poisoned the beginnings of your breaths,Believe that even in my deliberateness I was not deliberate.Though why should I whine,Whine that the crime was other than mine?--Since anyhow you are dead.Or rather, or instead,You were never made.But that too, I am afraid,Is faulty: oh, what shall I say, how is the truth to be said?You were born, you had body, you died.It is just that you never giggled or planned or cried.Believe me, I loved you all.Believe me, I knew you, though faintly, and I loved, I loved youAll. 
                        

                        THAT crazed girl improvising her music.Her poetry, dancing upon the shore,Her soul in division from itselfClimbing, falling She knew not where,Hiding amid the cargo of a steamship,Her knee-cap broken, that girl I declareA beautiful lofty thing, or a thingHeroically lost, heroically found.No matter what disaster occurredShe stood in desperate music wound,Wound, wound, and she made in her triumphWhere the bales and the baskets layNo common intelligible soundBut sang, 'O sea-starved, hungry sea.' 
                        

                        I am not yet born; O hear me.Let not the bloodsucking bat or the rat or the stoat or the     club-footed ghoul come near me.I am not yet born, console me.I fear that the human race may with tall walls wall me,     with strong drugs dope me, with wise lies lure me,        on black racks rack me, in blood-baths roll me.I am not yet born; provide meWith water to dandle me, grass to grow for me, trees to talk     to me, sky to sing to me, birds and a white light        in the back of my mind to guide me.I am not yet born; forgive meFor the sins that in me the world shall commit, my words     when they speak me, my thoughts when they think me,        my treason engendered by traitors beyond me,           my life when they murder by means of my              hands, my death when they live me.I am not yet born; rehearse meIn the parts I must play and the cues I must take when     old men lecture me, bureaucrats hector me, mountains        frown at me, lovers laugh at me, the white            waves call me to folly and the desert calls              me to doom and the beggar refuses                 my gift and my children curse me.I am not yet born; O hear me,Let not the man who is beast or who thinks he is God     come near me.I am not yet born; O fill meWith strength against those who would freeze my     humanity, would dragoon me into a lethal automaton,        would make me a cog in a machine, a thing with           one face, a thing, and against all those              who would dissipate my entirety, would                 blow me like thistledown hither and                    thither or hither and thither                       like water held in the                          hands would spill me.Let them not make me a stone and let them not spill me.Otherwise kill me. 
                        

                        Come to me in the silence of the night;Come in the speaking silence of a dream;Come with soft rounded cheeks and eyes as brightAs sunlight on a stream;Come back in tears,O memory, hope, love of finished years.O dream how sweet, too sweet, too bitter sweet,Whose wakening should have been in Paradise,Where souls brimfull of love abide and meet;Where thirsting longing eyesWatch the slow doorThat opening, letting in, lets out no more.Yet come to me in dreams, that I may liveMy very life again though cold in death:Come back to me in dreams, that I may givePulse for pulse, breath for breath:Speak low, lean lowAs long ago, my love, how long ago. 
                        

                        Amongst the flowers Iam alone with my pot of winedrinking by myself; then liftingmy cup I asked the moonto drink with me, its reflectionand mine in the wine cup, justthe three of us; then I sighfor the moon cannot drink,and my shadow goes emptily alongwith me never saying a word;with no other friends here, I canbut use these two for company;in the time of happiness, Itoo must be happy with allaround me; I sit and singand it is as if the moonaccompanies me; then if Idance, it is my shadow thatdances along with me; whilestill not drunk, I am gladto make the moon and my shadowinto friends, but then whenI have drunk too much, weall part; yet these arefriends I can always count onthese who have no emotionwhatsoever; I hope that one daywe three will meet again,deep in the Milky Way.

                        My love is like to ice, and I to fire:How comes it then that this her cold so greatIs not dissolved through my so hot desire, But harder grows the more I her entreat?Or how comes it that my exceeding heatIs not allayed by her heart-frozen cold,But that I burn much more in boiling sweat,And feel my flames augmented manifold?What more miraculous thing may be told, That fire, which all things melts, should harden ice,And ice, which is congeal's with senseless cold,Should kindle fire by wonderful device?Such is the power of love in gentle mind,That it can alter all the course of kind. 
                        

                        so much dependsupon a red wheelbarrow glazed with rainwater beside the whitechickens. 
                        

                        I have fallen from sky, Fallen to the ground, I am the angel of sadness, Angel of lost hopes, Angel of lost dreams, I am the fallen angel, Fear me not, I am here for reason, That reason is to have a second chance in life, That life I was given for a reason, They took my wings, They took me apart made me human, I was the fallen angel, But that fallen angel had one chance in life that she was given, This angel won’t make the same mistakes she made before, This angel will go down the right path that has been chosen for her, This fallen angel know what she has to do to be forgiven. 
                        

                        When despair grows in meand I wake in the night at the least soundin fear of what my life and my children's lives may be,I go and lie down where the wood drakerests in his beauty on the water, and the great heron feeds.I come into the peace of wild thingswho do not tax their lives with forethoughtof grief. I come into the presence of still water.And I feel above me the day-blind starswaiting for their light. For a timeI rest in the grace of the world, and am free. 
                        

                        No one worth possessingCan be quite possessed;Lay that on your heart,My young angry dear;This truth, this hard and precious stone,Lay it on your hot cheek,Let it hide your tear.Hold it like a crystalWhen you are aloneAnd gaze in the depths of the icy stone.Long, look long and you will be blessed:No one worth possessingCan be quite possessed. 
                        

                        Come live with me and be my love,And we will all the pleasures proveThat valleys, groves, hills, and fields,Woods, or steepy mountain yields.And we will sit upon rocks,Seeing the shepherds feed their flocks,By shallow rivers to whose fallsMelodious birds sing madrigals.And I will make thee beds of rosesAnd a thousand fragrant poises,A cap of flowers, and a kirtleEmbroidered all with leaves of myrtle; A gown made of the finest woolWhich from our pretty lambs we pull; Fair lined slippers for the cold,With buckles of the purest gold; A belt of straw and ivy buds,With coral clasps and amber studs; And if these pleasures may thee move,Come live with me, and be my love.The shepherds's swains shall dance and singFor thy delight each May morning:If these delights thy mind may move,Then live with me and be my love. 
                        

                        Let the snake wait underhis weedand the writingbe of words, slow and quick, sharpto strike, quiet to wait,sleepless.-- through metaphor to reconcilethe people and the stones.Compose. (No ideasbut in things) Invent!Saxifrage is my flower that splitsthe rocks. 
                        

                        The whiskey on your breath Could make a small boy dizzy; But I hung on like death: Such waltzing was not easy. We romped until the pans Slid from the kitchen shelf; My mother's countenance Could not unfrown itself. The hand that held my wrist Was battered on one knuckle; At every step you missed My right ear scraped a buckle. You beat time on my head With a palm caked hard by dirt, Then waltzed me off to bed Still clinging to your shirt. 
                        

                        To be in love Is to touch with a lighter hand. In yourself you stretch, you are well. You look at things Through his eyes. A cardinal is red. A sky is blue. Suddenly you know he knows too. He is not there but You know you are tasting together The winter, or a light spring weather. His hand to take your hand is overmuch. Too much to bear. You cannot look in his eyes Because your pulse must not say What must not be said. When he Shuts a door- Is not there_ Your arms are water. And you are free With a ghastly freedom. You are the beautiful half Of a golden hurt. You remember and covet his mouth To touch, to whisper on. Oh when to declare Is certain Death! Oh when to apprize Is to mesmerize, To see fall down, the Column of Gold, Into the commonest ash.Anonymous submission.

                        This game is the way in which slaughter becomes an end in itself. Acta est fabula plauditeThe play has been performed; applaud! Surely, less obvious ways existThe Darkness seeks to manipulate us into its service.Actus non facit reum nisi mens sit rea.The act is not guilty unless the mind is also guilty.Once all of them  have won a very special princess prize, the game is over....and they will never buy another one.....Alis grave nil.Nothing is heavy to those who have wingsAnd maybe we cannot understand what's going on, but we can understand  that the playersskillfully hide behind the walls....They think....Cessante ratione legis cessat ipsa lex.When the reason for the law ceases, the law itself ceases.We seek escape from reality, we undermine our self-esteem.Maybe we are unable to see them, but we need to talk about this.And maybe they do not trust us when we tell them to come to us if they needto talk........about those who become  their victims......Sed ipse Spiritus postulat pro nobis, gemitibus inenarrabilibus.But the same Spirit intercedes incessantly for us, with inexpressible groans.

                        If we must die, let it not be like hogsHunted and penned in an inglorious spot,While round us bark the mad and hungry dogs,Making their mock at our accursèd lot.If we must die, O let us nobly die,So that our precious blood may not be shedIn vain; then even the monsters we defyShall be constrained to honor us though dead!O kinsmen! we must meet the common foe!Though far outnumbered let us show us brave,And for their thousand blows deal one death-blow!What though before us lies the open grave?Like men we'll face the murderous, cowardly pack,Pressed to the wall, dying, but fighting back! 
                        

                        LIFE, believe, is not a dream  So dark as sages say;Oft a little morning rain  Foretells a pleasant day. Sometimes there are clouds of gloom,  But these are transient all;If the shower will make the roses bloom,  O why lament its fall ?     Rapidly, merrily,  Life's sunny hours flit by,    Gratefully, cheerily,  Enjoy them as they fly ! What though Death at times steps in  And calls our Best away ?What though sorrow seems to win,  O'er hope, a heavy sway ?Yet hope again elastic springs,  Unconquered, though she fell;Still buoyant are her golden wings,  Still strong to bear us well.    Manfully, fearlessly,  The day of trial bear,    For gloriously, victoriously,  Can courage quell despair ! 
                        

                        I Found you and I lost you, All on a gleaming day. The day was filled with sunshine, And the land was full of May.A golden bird was singing Its melody divine, I found you and I loved you, And all the world was mine.I found you and I lost you, All on a golden day, But when I dream of you, dear, It is always brimming May. 
                        

                        It little profits that an idle king, By this still hearth, among these barren crags, Match'd with an aged wife, I mete and dole Unequal laws unto a savage race, That hoard, and sleep, and feed, and know not me. I cannot rest from travel; I will drink Life to the lees.  All times I have enjoy'd Greatly, have suffer'd greatly, both with those That loved me, and alone; on shore, and when Thro' scudding drifts the rainy Hyades Vext the dim sea.  I am become a name; For always roaming with a hungry heart Much have I seen and known,-- cities of men And manners, climates, councils, governments, Myself not least, but honor'd of them all,-- And drunk delight of battle with my peers, Far on the ringing plains of windy Troy. I am a part of all that I have met; Yet all experience is an arch wherethro' Gleams that untravell'd world whose margin fades For ever and for ever when I move. How dull it is to pause, to make an end, To rust unburnish'd, not to shine in use! As tho' to breathe were life!  Life piled on life Were all too little, and of one to me Little remains; but every hour is saved >From that eternal silence, something more, A bringer of new things; and vile it were For some three suns to store and hoard myself, And this gray spirit yearning in desire To follow knowledge like a sinking star, Beyond the utmost bound of human thought. This is my son, mine own Telemachus, to whom I leave the sceptre and the isle,-- Well-loved of me, discerning to fulfill This labor, by slow prudence to make mild A rugged people, and thro' soft degrees Subdue them to the useful and the good. Most blameless is he, centred in the sphere Of common duties, decent not to fail In offices of tenderness, and pay Meet adoration to my household gods, When I am gone.  He works his work, I mine. There lies the port; the vessel puffs her sail; There gloom the dark, broad seas.  My mariners, Souls that have toil'd, and wrought, and thought with me,-- That ever with a frolic welcome took The thunder and the sunshine, and opposed Free hearts, free foreheads,-- you and I are old; Old age hath yet his honor and his toil. Death closes all; but something ere the end, Some work of noble note, may yet be done, Not unbecoming men that strove with Gods. The lights begin to twinkle from the rocks; The long day wanes; the slow moon climbs; the deep Moans round with many voices.  Come, my friends. 'T is not too late to seek a newer world. Push off, and sitting well in order smite The sounding furrows; for my purpose holds To sail beyond the sunset, and the baths Of all the western stars, until I die. It may be that the gulfs will wash us down; It may be we shall touch the Happy Isles, And see the great Achilles, whom we knew. Tho' much is taken, much abides; and tho' We are not now that strength which in old days Moved earth and heaven, that which we are, we are,-- One equal temper of heroic hearts, Made weak by time and fate, but strong in will To strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield.

                        A fond kiss, and then we sever;A farewell, and then forever! Deep in heart-wrung tears I'll pledge thee,Warring sighs and groans I'll wage thee.Who shall say that Fortune grieves him,While the star of hope she leaves him?Me, nae cheerfu' twinkle lights me;Dark despair around benights me.I'll ne'er blame my partial fancy,Nothing could resist my Nancy;But to see her was to love her;Love but her, and love forever.Had we never lov'd say kindly,Had we never lov'd say blindly,Never met--or never parted--We had ne'er been broken-hearted.Fare thee well, thou first and fairest!Fare thee well, thou best and dearest!Thine be like a joy and treasure,Peace. enjoyment, love, and pleasure!A fond kiss, and then we sever;A farewell, alas, forever!Deep in heart-wrung tears I'll pledge thee,Warring sighs and groans I'll wage thee! 
                        

                        Yearning for tenderness.The one lost —It's so long -so longSince..The light delves deep in the wateryUnconsciousness of an unnatural essence, Just to find nothing.Longing for what went missing at some pointSomewhere, in the long journey, is a beguilingDead end.Come what may, Pushed from pillar to post —Worn byThe wrinkles on the foreheadWithout destination, LonelinessRegrets what's gone lost, Keeping its scent forever.(Florence,2014)    Copyright © Fabrizio Frosini - All rights reserved 
                        

                        Nobody heard him, the dead man,But still he lay moaning:I was much further out than you thoughtAnd not waving but drowning.Poor chap, he always loved larkingAnd now he's deadIt must have been too cold for him his heart gave way,They said.Oh, no no no, it was too cold always(Still the dead one lay moaning)I was much too far out all my lifeAnd not waving but drowning. 
                        

                        The fog comeson little cat feet.It sits lookingover harbor and cityon silent haunchesand then moves on.

                        It may be misery not to sing at all, And to go silent through the brimming day; It may be misery never to be loved, But deeper griefs than these beset the way.To sing the perfect song, And by a half-tone lost the key, There the potent sorrow, there the grief, The pale, sad staring of Life's Tragedy.To have come near to the perfect love, Not the hot passion of untempered youth, But that which lies aside its vanity, And gives, for thy trusting worship, truth.This, this indeed is to be accursed, For if we mortals love, or if we sing, We count our joys not by what we have, But by what kept us from that perfect thing. 
                        

                        If starry space no limit knows      And sun succeeds to sun,There is no reason to suppose      Our earth the only one.'Mid countless constellations cast      A million worlds may be,With each a God to bless or blast      And steer to destiny. Just think! A million gods or so      To guide each vital stream,With over all to boss the show      A Deity supreme.Such magnitudes oppress my mind;      From cosmic space it swings;So ultimately glad to find      Relief in little things.For look! Within my hollow hand,      While round the earth careens,I hold a single grain of sand      And wonder what it means.Ah! If I had the eyes to see,      And brain to understand,I think Life's mystery might be      Solved in this grain of sand. 
                        

                        I was stepping in to become youngI thought it is nice journey but too longI am afraid and take care not to go wrongI was expecting everything for songI am so much influenced by lady smileShe has entered in life just before while'Life seems to be so interesting and fineI want to dance on floor with glass of wineMiss, you can't be so rude For a word you have made prelude, All warmth and affection you have included Hate and distance you have excluded I never expected you to cast All doubts but trust should not last You were the first to realize it fastReality known but never wore any kind of mast, Your innocence and name is kind to infuse Kind words for me but not meant to confuseTime was for decision but you never refusedAlways stood at right point and crisis defused Even amidst delicate moments You did not offer a word or commentsYou were hurt most but you used simple word, Is it blessings to you or gift from Lord? I loved you most as your dearest friend Still you didn't put any word at the end, Kept me at dark or asked or any excuse Used otherwise it as pretext, denied or refused 'Miss' I miss you but you don't miss, Did not expect from you kind hug or simple kissNot even kind gesture or more of any show Still I miss you and never beat eye brow Will this uncertainty remain or go? Life will be full of remorse but still I would forgoIs there any restriction from your side or embargo? You bear always 'no entry' smile with logo You called on me for good luck and best wishes I remained dead as no water was available for fish, May be it is very hard to swallow for some reasons Why then there should be drought without any season? I was quick to grasp situation, Avoided unwarranted efforts for persuasion, Shock was sudden and heavy but came very late, I did accept it with grace and as part of fateShe didn't become mine for some reasonsI waited simply for spring seasonShe too eagerly longed for strong bondAs I was inclined and very fondShe had everything to looseBut she had no option to chooseWhy did she take extreme step? She always used to call me as sweet babeIt may be her way of thinkingIt left me high and dry with blinkingWhat should I call her sacrifice? A step of dedication or break of promises? 
                        

                        I come from a musical placeWhere they shoot me for my songAnd my brother has been torturedBy my brother in my land.I come from a beautiful placeWhere they hate my shade of skinThey don't like the way I prayAnd they ban free poetry. I come from a beautiful placeWhere girls cannot go to schoolThere you are told what to believeAnd even young boys must grow beards. I come from a great old forestI think it is now a fieldAnd the people I once knewAre not there now. We can all be refugeesNobody is safe,All it takes is a mad leaderOr no rain to bring forth food,We can all be refugeesWe can all be told to go,We can be hated by someoneFor being someone. I come from a beautiful placeWhere the valley floods each yearAnd each year the hurricane tells usThat we must keep moving on. I come from an ancient placeAll my family were born thereAnd I would like to go thereBut I really want to live. I come from a sunny, sandy placeWhere tourists go to darken skinAnd dealers like to sell guns thereI just can't tell you what's the price. I am told I have no country nowI am told I am a lieI am told that modern history booksMay forget my name. We can all be refugeesSometimes it only takes a day,Sometimes it only takes a handshakeOr a paper that is signed.We all came from refugeesNobody simply just appeared,Nobody's here without a struggle,And why should we live in fearOf the weather or the troubles?We all came here from somewhere. 
                        

                        FERRARA.That's my last Duchess painted on the wall,Looking as if she were alive.  I callThat piece a wonder, now: Fr Pandolf's handsWorked busily a day, and there she stands.Will't please you sit and look at her? I said``Fr Pandolf'' by design, for never readStrangers like you that pictured countenance,The depth and passion of its earnest glance,But to myself they turned (since none puts byThe curtain I have drawn for you, but I)And seemed as they would ask me, if they durst,How such a glance came there; so, not the firstAre you to turn and ask thus.  Sir, 'twas notHer husband's presence only, called that spotOf joy into the Duchess' cheek: perhapsFr Pandolf chanced to say ``Her mantle laps``Over my lady's wrist too much,'' or ``Paint``Must never hope to reproduce the faint``Half-flush that dies along her throat:'' such stuffWas courtesy, she thought, and cause enoughFor calling up that spot of joy.  She hadA heart---how shall I say?---too soon made glad,Too easily impressed; she liked whate'erShe looked on, and her looks went everywhere.  Sir, 'twas all one! My favour at her breast,The dropping of the daylight in the West,The bough of cherries some officious foolBroke in the orchard for her, the white muleShe rode with round the terrace---all and eachWould draw from her alike the approving speech,Or blush, at least.  She thanked men,---good! but thankedSomehow---I know not how---as if she rankedMy gift of a nine-hundred-years-old nameWith anybody's gift.  Who'd stoop to blameThis sort of trifling? Even had you skillIn speech---(which I have not)---to make your willQuite clear to such an one, and say, ``Just this``Or that in you disgusts me; here you miss,``Or there exceed the mark''---and if she letHerself be lessoned so, nor plainly setHer wits to yours, forsooth, and made excuse,---E'en then would be some stooping; and I chooseNever to stoop.  Oh sir, she smiled, no doubt,Whene'er I passed her; but who passed withoutMuch the same smile? This grew; I gave commands;Then all smiles stopped together.  There she standsAs if alive.  Will't please you rise? We'll meetThe company below, then.  I repeat,The Count your master's known munificenceIs ample warrant that no just pretenceOf mine for dowry will be disallowed;Though his fair daughter's self, as I avowedAt starting, is my object.  Nay, we'll goTogether down, sir. Notice Neptune, though,Taming a sea-horse, thought a rarity,Which Claus of Innsbruck cast in bronze for me! 
                        

                        LOVE - what is love?  A great and aching heart;Wrung hands; and silence; and a long despair.Life - what is life?  Upon a moorland bareTo see love coming and see love depart. 
                        

                        This is the place.  Stand still, my steed,  Let me review the scene,And summon from the shadowy Past  The forms that once have been.The Past and Present here unite  Beneath Time's flowing tide,Like footprints hidden by a brook,  But seen on either side.Here runs the highway to the town;  There the green lane descends,Through which I walked to church with thee,  O gentlest of my friends!The shadow of the linden-trees  Lay moving on the grass;Between them and the moving boughs,  A shadow, thou didst pass.Thy dress was like the lilies,  And thy heart as pure as they:One of God's holy messengers  Did walk with me that day.I saw the branches of the trees  Bend down thy touch to meet,The clover-blossoms in the grass  Rise up to kiss thy feet,"Sleep, sleep to-day, tormenting cares,  Of earth and folly born!"Solemnly sang the village choir  On that sweet Sabbath morn.Through the closed blinds the golden sun  Poured in a dusty beam,Like the celestial ladder seen  By Jacob in his dream.And ever and anon, the wind,  Sweet-scented with the hay,Turned o'er the hymn-book's fluttering leaves That on the window lay.Long was the good man's sermon,  Yet it seemed not so to me;For he spake of Ruth the beautiful,  And still I thought of thee.Long was the prayer he uttered,  Yet it seemed not so to me;For in my heart I prayed with him,  And still I thought of thee.But now, alas! the place seems changed;  Thou art no longer here:Part of the sunshine of the scene  With thee did disappear.Though thoughts, deep-rooted in my heart,  Like pine-trees dark and high,Subdue the light of noon, and breathe  A low and ceaseless sigh;This memory brightens o'er the past,  As when the sun, concealedBehind some cloud that near us hangs  Shines on a distant field. 
                        

                        Just past dawn, the sun standswith its heavy red headin a black stanchion of trees,waiting for someone to comewith his bucketfor the foamy white light,and then a long day in the pasture.I too spend my days grazing,feasting on every green momenttill darkness calls,and with the othersI walk away into the night,swinging the little tin bellof my name. 
                        

                        Do you remember an Inn,Miranda?Do you remember an Inn?And the tedding and the spreadingOf the straw for a bedding,And the fleas that tease in the High Pyrenees,And the wine that tasted of tar?And the cheers and the jeers of the young muleteers(Under the vine of the dark veranda)?Do you remember an Inn, Miranda,Do you remember an Inn?And the cheers and the jeers of the young muleteersWho hadn't got a penny,And who weren't paying any,And the hammer at the doors and the din?And the hip! hop! hap!Of the clapOf the hands to the swirl and the twirlOf the girl gone chancing,Glancing,Dancing,Backing and advancing,Snapping of the clapper to the spinOut and in--And the ting, tong, tang of the guitar!Do you remember an Inn,Miranda?Do you remember an Inn?Never more;Miranda,Never more.Only the high peaks hoar;And Aragon a torrent at the door.No soundIn the walls of the halls where fallsThe treadOf the feet of the dead to the ground,No sound:But the boomOf the far waterfall like doom.

                        I come from haunts of coot and hern, I make a sudden sally And sparkle out among the fern, To bicker down a valley. By thirty hills I hurry down, Or slip between the ridges, By twenty thorpes, a little town, And half a hundred bridges. Till last by Philip's farm I flow To join the brimming river, For men may come and men may go, But I go on for ever. I chatter over stony ways, In little sharps and trebles, I bubble into eddying bays, I babble on the pebbles. With many a curve my banks I fret By many a field and fallow, And many a fairy foreland set With willow-weed and mallow. I chatter, chatter, as I flow To join the brimming river, For men may come and men may go, But I go on for ever. I wind about, and in and out, With here a blossom sailing, And here and there a lusty trout, And here and there a grayling, And here and there a foamy flake Upon me, as I travel With many a silvery waterbreak Above the golden gravel, And draw them all along, and flow To join the brimming river For men may come and men may go, But I go on for ever. I steal by lawns and grassy plots, I slide by hazel covers; I move the sweet forget-me-nots That grow for happy lovers. I slip, I slide, I gloom, I glance, Among my skimming swallows; I make the netted sunbeam dance Against my sandy shallows. I murmur under moon and stars In brambly wildernesses; I linger by my shingly bars; I loiter round my cresses; And out again I curve and flow To join the brimming river, For men may come and men may go, But I go on for ever. 
                        

                        Good-night? ah! no; the hour is illWhich severs those it should unite;Let us remain together still,Then it will be good night.How can I call the lone night good,Though thy sweet wishes wing its flight?Be it not said, thought, understood --Then it will be -- good night.To hearts which near each other moveFrom evening close to morning light,The night is good; because, my love,They never say good-night. 
                        

                        There is a place where the sidewalk endsand before the street begins,and there the grass grows soft and white,and there the sun burns crimson bright,and there the moon-bird rests from his flightto cool in the peppermint wind.Let us leave this place where the smoke blows blackand the dark street winds and bends.Past the pits where the asphalt flowers growwe shall walk with a walk that is measured and slowand watch where the chalk-white arrows goto the place where the sidewalk ends.Yes we'll walk with a walk that is measured and slow,and we'll go where the chalk-white arrows go,for the children, they mark, and the children, they know,the place where the sidewalk ends. 
                        

                        All nature has a feeling: woods, fields, brooksAre life eternal: and in silence theySpeak happiness beyond the reach of books;There's nothing mortal in them; their decayIs the green life of change; to pass awayAnd come again in blooms revivified.Its birth was heaven, eternal it its stay,And with the sun and moon shall still abideBeneath their day and night and heaven wide. 
                        

                        Anyone here had a go at themselvesfor a laugh? Anyone opened their wristswith a blade in the bath? Those in the darkat the back, listen hard. Those at the frontin the know, those of us who have, hands up,let's show that inch of lacerated skinbetween the forearm and the fist. Let's tell itlike it is: strong drink, a crimson tidemarkround the tub, a yard of lint, white towelswashed a dozen times, still pink. Tough luck.A passion then for watches, bangles, cuffs.A likely story: you were lashed by bramblespicking berries from the woods. Come clean, come good,repeat with me the punch line 'Just like blood'when those at the back rush forward to sayhow a little love goes a long long long way. 
                        

                        My eyes already touch the sunny hill.going far ahead of the road I have begun.So we are grasped by what we cannot grasp;it has inner light, even from a distance-and charges us, even if we do not reach it,into something else, which, hardly sensing it,we already are; a gesture waves us onanswering our own wave...but what we feel is the wind in our faces.Translated by Robert Bly 
                        

                        I said to Love, "It is not now as in old days When men adored thee and thy ways    All else above; Named thee the Boy, the Bright, the One Who spread a heaven beneath the sun,"    I said to Love.    I said to him, "We now know more of thee than then; We were but weak in judgment when,    With hearts abrim, We clamoured thee that thou would'st please Inflict on us thine agonies,"    I said to him.    I said to Love, "Thou art not young, thou art not fair, No faery darts, no cherub air,    Nor swan, nor dove Are thine; but features pitiless, And iron daggers of distress,"    I said to Love.    "Depart then, Love! . . . - Man's race shall end, dost threaten thou? The age to come the man of now    Know nothing of? - We fear not such a threat from thee; We are too old in apathy! Mankind shall cease.--So let it be,"    I said to Love. 
                        

                        When these graven lines you see, Traveller, do not pity me; Though I be among the dead, Let no mournful word be said.Children that I leave behind, And their children, all were kind; Near to them and to my wife, I was happy all my life.My three sons I married right, And their sons I rocked at night; Death nor sorrow never brought Cause for one unhappy thought.Now, and with no need of tears, Here they leave me, full of years,-- Leave me to my quiet rest In the region of the blest. 
                        

                        XIVIf thou must love me, let it be for noughtExcept for love's sake only. Do not say'I love her for her smile—her look—her wayOf speaking gently,—for a trick of thoughtThat falls in well with mine, and certes broughtA sense of pleasant ease on such a day'—For these things in themselves, Beloved, mayBe changed, or change for thee,—and love, so wrought,May be unwrought so. Neither love me forThine own dear pity's wiping my cheeks dry,—A creature might forget to weep, who boreThy comfort long, and lose thy love thereby!But love me for love's sake, that evermoreThou mayst love on, through love's eternity.

                        What lips my lips have kissed, and where, and why, I have forgotten, and what arms have lain Under my head till morning; but the rain Is full of ghosts tonight, that tap and sigh Upon the glass and listen for reply, And in my heart there stirs a quiet pain For unremembered lads that not again Will turn to me at midnight with a cry. Thus in winter stands the lonely tree, Nor knows what birds have vanished one by one, Yet knows its boughs more silent than before: I cannot say what loves have come and gone, I only know that summer sang in me A little while, that in me sings no more.

                        And a youth said, "Speak to us of Friendship." Your friend is your needs answered. He is your field which you sow with love and reap with thanksgiving. And he is your board and your fireside. For you come to him with your hunger, and you seek him for peace. When your friend speaks his mind you fear not the "nay" in your own mind, nor do you withhold the "ay." And when he is silent your heart ceases not to listen to his heart; For without words, in friendship, all thoughts, all desires, all expectations are born and shared, with joy that is unacclaimed. When you part from your friend, you grieve not; For that which you love most in him may be clearer in his absence, as the mountain to the climber is clearer from the plain. And let there be no purpose in friendship save the deepening of the spirit. For love that seeks aught but the disclosure of its own mystery is not love but a net cast forth: and only the unprofitable is caught. And let your best be for your friend. If he must know the ebb of your tide, let him know its flood also. For what is your friend that you should seek him with hours to kill? Seek him always with hours to live. For it is his to fill your need, but not your emptiness. And in the sweetness of friendship let there be laughter, and sharing of pleasures. For in the dew of little things the heart finds its morning and is refreshed. 
                        

                        Love and lust are poles apart.  Lust is chaos, love is art.Love infinite, lust is finite.Love is sustained, lust is short.Love is spiritual, lust is physical.Love is ideal, lust is sensual.Love is selfless, lust is selfishLove immortal, lust is mortal. Love is productive, lust is destructive.Love is optional, lust is impulsive.Love is energetic, lust is crazy.Love is humanist, lust instinctive.Lust is rabid dog, love is padagog.Love demands inner beauty, lust demands appearance.Lust starts from black holes of eyes, love from conscientious part of heart.Love develops in brain, lust develops in gonads.Lust stays on surface of the words, but love in depths of unconscious.Love is rationally emotional, lust is emotionally rational. Love is Allopath, lust is Psychopath. Love is Homoeopath, lust is Sociopath. Love kisses, lust disses.Love honours, lust ravishes.Love insight, lust is blind.Lust devours, Love nourishes.Love replays, lust betrays.Love impresses, lust oppresses. Love centralizes, lust strays.Love expresses, lust depresses. Love is healthy, lust is lame. Lust is gambling, love is game. Love is Platonic, lust is Bubonic. Lust is shameless, love is shame. Lust is volcano, love is rain.Love is Abel, lust is Cain.Prophets weep, Demons laugh.Love is fruitful, lust is vain.Love is need, lust is greed. Lust is maniac, love is sane.Lust is a beast, love is dove.Lust is hatred, love is loveLust is passion, love compassion.Lust is beneath, love above.Love is even climb, it is never lost. Lust is a decline, it is ever lost.Love is always true to the core but lust is hyperbole.Love provides endless satisfaction, lust ends at opposite pole.Love is the base of this universe, Lust is baseless in itself.My subject is my subject. Such enveloping my subject. Such as God to His universe. Such as Devil to this universe. Love is a sincerity and responsibility. Lust is insincerity, irresponsibility. Confirmation test is just, sacrifice or obedience. Both or only one is must. Lust is aimless without love.Love is aimful without lust.My subject is thy subject. My subject is love and lust. I can tell you one secret. Love and lust are poles apart. But make union only when. Lust is second, love is first.Just, ask a victim of lust. 
                        

                        A dream lies dead here. May you softly go Before this place, and turn away your eyes, Nor seek to know the look of that which dies Importuning Life for life. Walk not in woe, But, for a little, let your step be slow. And, of your mercy, be not sweetly wise With words of hope and Spring and tenderer skies. A dream lies dead; and this all mourners know: Whenever one drifted petal leaves the tree- Though white of bloom as it had been before And proudly waitful of fecundity- One little loveliness can be no more; And so must Beauty bow her imperfect head Because a dream has joined the wistful dead! 
                        

                        Star, that gives a gracious dole,  What am I to choose?Oh, will it be a shriven soul,  Or little buckled shoes?Shall I wish a wedding-ring,  Bright and thin and round,Or plead you send me covering-  A newly spaded mound?Gentle beam, shall I implore  Gold, or sailing-ships,Or beg I hate forevermore  A pair of lying lips?Swing you low or high away,  Burn you hot or dim;My only wish I dare not say-  Lest you should grant me him. 
                        

                        You have to be always drunk. That's all there is to it--it's the only way. So as not to feel the horrible burden of time that breaks your back and bends you to the earth, you have to be continually drunk. But on what?Wine, poetry or virtue, as you wish. But be drunk. And if sometimes, on the steps of a palace or the green grass of a ditch, in the mournful solitude of your room, you wake again, drunkenness already diminishing or gone, ask the wind, the wave, the star, the bird, the clock, everything that is flying, everything that is groaning, everything that is rolling, everything that is singing, everything that is speaking. . .ask what time it is and wind, wave, star, bird, clock will answer you:"It is time to be drunk! So as not to be the martyred slaves of time, be drunk, becontinually drunk! On wine, on poetry or on virtue as you wish." 
                        

                        On Raglan Road on an autumn day I met her first and knew That her dark hair would weave a snare that I might one day rue; I saw the danger, yet I walked along the enchanted way, And I said, let grief be a fallen leaf at the dawning of the day. On Grafton Street in November we tripped lightly along the ledge Of the deep ravine where can be seen the worth of passion's pledge, The Queen of Hearts still making tarts and I not making hay - O I loved too much and by such and such is happiness thrown away. I gave her gifts of the mind I gave her the secret sign that's known To the artists who have known the true gods of sound and stone And word and tint. I did not stint for I gave her poems to say. With her own name there and her own dark hair like clouds over fields of May On a quiet street where old ghosts meet I see her walking now Away from me so hurriedly my reason must allow That I had wooed not as I should a creature made of clay - When the angel woos the clay he'd lose his wings at the dawn of day. 
                        

                        I Remember, I RememberI remember, I remember The house where I was born, The little window where the sun Came peeping in at morn; He never came a wink too soon Nor brought too long a day; But now, I often wish the night Had borne my breath away.I remember, I remember The roses red and white, The violets and the lily cups-- Those flowers made of light! The lilacs where the robin built, And where my brother set The laburnum on his birthday,-- The tree is living yet!I remember, I remember Where I was used to swing, And thought the air must rush as fresh To swallows on the wing; My spirit flew in feathers then That is so heavy now, The summer pools could hardly cool The fever on my brow.I remember, I remember The fir-trees dark and high; I used to think their slender tops Were close against the sky: It was a childish ignorance, But now 'tis little joy To know I'm farther off from Heaven Than when I was a boy. 
                        

                        You're in this dream of cotton plants.You raise a hoe, swing, and the first weedsFall with a sigh. You take another step,Chop, and the sigh comes again,Until you yourself are breathing that wayWith each step, a sigh that will follow you into town.That's hours later. The sun is a red blisterComing up in your palm. Your back is strong,Young, not yet the broken chairIn an abandoned school of dry spiders. Dust settles on your forehead, dirtSmiles under each fingernail.You chop, step, and by the end of the first row,You can buy one splendid fish for wifeAnd three sons. Another row, another fish,Until you have enough and move on to milk,Bread, meat. Ten hours and the cupboards creak.You can rest in the back yard under a tree.Your hands twitch on your lap,Not unlike the fish on a pier or the bottomOf a boat. You drink iced tea. The minutes jerkLike flies. 			It's dusk, now night,And the lights in your home are on.That costs money, yellow lightIn the kitchen. That's thirty steps,You say to your hands,Now shaped into binoculars.You could raise them to your eyes:You were a fool in school, now look at you.You're a giant among cotton plants.Now you see your oldest boy, also running.Papa, he says, it's time to come in.You pull him into your lapAnd ask, What's forty times nine?He knows as well as you, and you smile.The wind makes peace with the trees,The stars strike themselves in the dark.You get up and walk with the sigh of cotton plants.You go to sleep with a red sun on your palm,The sore light you see when you first stir in bed.

                        They leave their homes Unwillingly forced And follow their fate Through fields and trails Massifs and woods With all their goods  Love and hate Mores and tales All in bales Carrying their own Flesh and bones Feet like stones Their bodies and souls Kids and crones Torn by storms, Rains and gales Attacked by guns, Helis and drones No role to play In games of peace And deadly war Not a word they say But a question, Why?

                        All the birds have flown up and gone; A lonely cloud floats leisurely by.We never tire of looking at each other -Only the mountain and I. 
                        

                        He thought he saw an ElephantThat practised on a fife:He looked again, and found it wasA letter from his wife.'At length I realize,' he said,'The bitterness of life! 'He thought he saw a BuffaloUpon the chimney-piece:He looked again, and found it wasHis Sister's Husband's Niece.'Unless you leave this house,' he said,'I'll send for the police! 'he thought he saw a RattlesnakeThat questioned him in Greek:He looked again, and found it wasThe Middle of Next Week.'The one thing I regret,' he said,'Is that it cannot speak! 'He thought he saw a Banker's ClerkDescending from the bus:He looked again, and found it wasA Hippopotamus.'If this should stay to dine,' he said,'There won't be much for us! 'He thought he saw a KangarooThat worked a Coffee-mill:He looked again, and found it wasA Vegetable-Pill.'Were I to swallow this,' he said,'I should be very ill!

                        She walks in Beauty, like the nightOf cloudless climes and starry skies;And all that's best of dark and brightMeet in her aspect and her eyes:Thus mellowed to that tender lightWhich Heaven to gaudy day denies.One shade the more, one ray the less,Had half impaired the nameless graceWhich waves in every raven tress,Or softly lightens o'er her face;Where thoughts serenely sweet express,How pure, how dear their dwelling-place.And on that cheek, and o'er that brow,So soft, so calm, yet eloquent,The smiles that win, the tints that glow,But tell of days in goodness spent,A mind at peace with all below,A heart whose love is innocent! 
                        

                        We think forever for salvation, We cannot live in separation.Father is great solves situation, Continuous is human migration.While we come we see garden, Man becomes here its warden.We cannot escape from work, We have to walk in row of murk.Life has its own meaning here, We have to live in time in cheer.Fear we do not we think again, In joy and grief we do remain.Pain we wash with water nice, Here we read book we see thrice.Ice melts by getting sun rays sure, By his wisdom we become pure.Nature is such beautiful narration, Life has a meaning and celebration.Glory of father we sing in adoration, Father of heaven gives love vibration. 
                        

                        The sun has burst the skyBecause I love youAnd the river its banks.The sea laps the great rocksBecause I love youAnd takes no heed of the moon dragging it awayAnd saying coldly 'Constancy is not for you'.The blackbird fills the airBecause I love youWith spring and lawns and shadows falling on lawns.The people walk in the street and laughI love youAnd far down the river ships sound their hootersCrazy with joy because I love you. 
                        

                        The tree has entered my hands,The sap has ascended my arms,The tree has grown in my breast -Downward,The branches grow out of me, like arms.Tree you are,Moss you are,You are violets with wind above them.A child - so high - you are,And all this is folly to the world. 
                        

                        All Things will DieClearly the blue river chimes in its flowing     Under my eye;Warmly and broadly the south winds are blowing     Over the sky.One after another the white clouds are fleeting;Every heart this May morning in joyance is beating     Full merrily;  Yet all things must die.The stream will cease to flow;The wind will cease to blow;The clouds will cease to fleet;The heart will cease to beat;  For all things must die.     All things must die.Spring will come never more.     O, vanity!Death waits at the door.See! our friends are all forsakingThe wine and the merrymaking.We are call’d–we must go.Laid low, very low,In the dark we must lie.The merry glees are still;The voice of the birdShall no more be heard,Nor the wind on the hill.     O, misery!Hark! death is callingWhile I speak to ye,The jaw is falling,The red cheek paling,The strong limbs failing;Ice with the warm blood mixing;The eyeballs fixing.Nine times goes the passing bell:Ye merry souls, farewell.     The old earth     Had a birth,     As all men know,     Long ago.And the old earth must die.So let the warm winds range,And the blue wave beat the shore;For even and mornYe will never seeThro’ eternity.All things were born.Ye will come never more,For all things must die. 
                        

                        Down behind the dustbinI met a dog called Ted.‘Leave me alone,’ he says,‘I’m just going to bed.’Down behind the dustbinI met a dog called Roger.‘Do you own this bin?’ I said.‘No. I’m only a lodger.’Down behind the dustbinI met a dog called Sue.‘What are you doing here?’ I said.‘I’ve got nothing else to do.’

                        I do not think of you lying in the wet clayOf a Monaghan graveyard; I seeYou walking down a lane among the poplarsOn your way to the station, or happilyGoing to second Mass on a summer Sunday -You meet me and you say:'Don't forget to see about the cattle - 'Among your earthiest words the angels stray.And I think of you walking along a headlandOf green oats in June,So full of repose, so rich with life -And I see us meeting at the end of a townOn a fair day by accident, afterThe bargains are all made and we can walkTogether through the shops and stalls and marketsFree in the oriental streets of thought.O you are not lying in the wet clay,For it is a harvest evening now and weAre piling up the ricks against the moonlightAnd you smile up at us - eternally. 
                        

                        In my dream, drilling into the marrow of my entire bone, my real dream, I'm walking up and down Beacon Hill searching for a street sign - namely MERCY STREET. Not there. I try the Back Bay. Not there. Not there. And yet I know the number. 45 Mercy Street. I know the stained-glass window of the foyer, the three flights of the house with its parquet floors. I know the furniture and mother, grandmother, great-grandmother, the servants. I know the cupboard of Spode the boat of ice, solid silver, where the butter sits in neat squares like strange giant's teeth on the big mahogany table. I know it well. Not there. Where did you go? 45 Mercy Street, with great-grandmother kneeling in her whale-bone corset and praying gently but fiercely to the wash basin, at five A.M. at noon dozing in her wiggy rocker, grandfather taking a nap in the pantry, grandmother pushing the bell for the downstairs maid, and Nana rocking Mother with an oversized flower on her forehead to cover the curl of when she was good and when she was... And where she was begat and in a generation the third she will beget, me, with the stranger's seed blooming into the flower called Horrid. I walk in a yellow dress and a white pocketbook stuffed with cigarettes, enough pills, my wallet, my keys, and being twenty-eight, or is it forty-five? I walk. I walk. I hold matches at street signs for it is dark, as dark as the leathery dead and I have lost my green Ford, my house in the suburbs, two little kids sucked up like pollen by the bee in me and a husband who has wiped off his eyes in order not to see my inside out and I am walking and looking and this is no dream just my oily life where the people are alibis and the street is unfindable for an entire lifetime. Pull the shades down - I don't care! Bolt the door, mercy, erase the number, rip down the street sign, what can it matter, what can it matter to this cheapskate who wants to own the past that went out on a dead ship and left me only with paper? Not there. I open my pocketbook, as women do, and fish swim back and forth between the dollars and the lipstick. I pick them out, one by one and throw them at the street signs, and shoot my pocketbook into the Charles River. Next I pull the dream off and slam into the cement wall of the clumsy calendar I live in, my life, and its hauled up notebooks. 
                        

                        Between us now and here -    Two thrown together Who are not wont to wear    Life's flushest feather - Who see the scenes slide past, The daytimes dimming fast, Let there be truth at last,    Even if despair. So thoroughly and long    Have you now known me, So real in faith and strong    Have I now shown me, That nothing needs disguise Further in any wise, Or asks or justifies    A guarded tongue. Face unto face, then, say,    Eyes mine own meeting, Is your heart far away,    Or with mine beating? When false things are brought low, And swift things have grown slow, Feigning like froth shall go,    Faith be for aye. 
                        

                        We will be what we could be. Do not say, "It might have been, had not this, or that, or this." No fate can keep us from the chosen way; He only might who is. We will do what we could do. Do not dream Chance leaves a hero, all uncrowned to grieve. I hold, all men are greatly what they seem; He does, who could achieve. We will climb where we could climb. Tell me not Of adverse storms that kept thee from the height. What eagle ever missed the peak he sought? He always climbs who might. I do not like the phrase "It might have been!" It lacks force, and life's best truths perverts: For I believe we have, and reach, and win, Whatever our deserts. 
                        

                        Once there was a tree....and she loved a little boy.And everyday the boy would comeand he would gather her leavesand make them into crownsand play king of the forest.He would climb up her trunkand swing from her branchesand eat apples.And they would play hide-and-go-seek.And when he was tired,he would sleep in her shade.And the boy loved the tree....very much.And the tree was happy.But time went by.And the boy grew older.And the tree was often alone.Then one day the boy came to the treeand the tree said, 'Come, Boy, come andclimb up my trunk and swing from my branches and eat apples and play in myshade and be happy.''I am too big to climb and play' saidthe boy.'I want to buy things and have fun.I want some money?''I'm sorry,' said the tree, 'but Ihave no money.I have only leaves and apples.Take my apples, Boy, and sell them in the city. Then you will have money andyou will be happy.'And so the boy climbed up thetree and gathered her applesand carried them away.And the tree was happy.But the boy stayed away for a long time....and the tree was sad.And then one day the boy came backand the tree shook with joyand she said, 'Come, Boy, climb up my trunkand swing from my branches and be happy.''I am too busy to climb trees,' said the boy.'I want a house to keep me warm,' he said.'I want a wife and I want children,and so I need a house.Can you give me a house ?' ' I have no house,' said the tree.'The forest is my house,but you may cut off my branches and build a house. Then you will be happy.'And so the boy cut off her branchesand carried them awayto build his house.And the tree was happy.But the boy stayed away for a long time.And when he came back,the tree was so happyshe could hardly speak.'Come, Boy,' she whispered,'come and play.''I am too old and sad to play,'said the boy.'I want a boat that will take me far away from here.Can you give me a boat?''Cut down my trunkand make a boat,' said the tree.'Then you can sail away...and be happy.'And so the boy cut down her trunkand made a boat and sailed away.And the tree was happy... but not really.And after a long timethe boy came back again.'I am sorry, Boy,'said the tree,' but I have nothingleft to give you -My apples are gone.''My teeth are too weakfor apples,' said the boy.'My branches are gone,'said the tree. ' Youcannot swing on them - ''I am too old to swingon branches,' said the boy.'My trunk is gone, ' said the tree.'You cannot climb - ''I am too tired to climb' said the boy.'I am sorry,' sighed the tree.'I wish that I could give you something....but I have nothing left. I am just an old stump.I am sorry....''I don't need very much now,' said the boy.'just a quiet place to sit and rest.I am very tired.''Well,' said the tree, straighteningherself up as much as she could,'well, an old stump is good for sitting and restingCome, Boy, sit down. Sit down and rest.'And the boy did. And the tree was happy. 
                        

                        As virtuous men pass mildly away,     And whisper to their souls, to go,Whilst some of their sad friends do say,     'The breath goes now,' and some say, 'No:'So let us melt, and make no noise,    No tear-floods, nor sigh-tempests move;'Twere profanation of our joys    To tell the laity our love.Moving of th' earth brings harms and fears;    Men reckon what it did, and meant;But trepidation of the spheres,    Though greater far, is innocent.Dull sublunary lovers' love    (Whose soul is sense) cannot admitAbsence, because it doth remove    Those things which elemented it.But we by a love so much refin'd,    That ourselves know not what it is,Inter-assured of the mind,    Care less, eyes, lips, and hands to miss.Our two souls therefore, which are one,    Though I must go, endure not yetA breach, but an expansion,    Like gold to airy thinness beat.If they be two, they are two so    As stiff twin compasses are two;Thy soul, the fix'd foot, makes no show    To move, but doth, if the' other do.And though it in the centre sit,    Yet when the other far doth roam,It leans, and hearkens after it,    And grows erect, as that comes home.Such wilt thou be to me, who must    Like th' other foot, obliquely run;Thy firmness makes my circle just,    And makes me end, where I begun. 
                        

                        I shot an arrow into the air,It fell to earth, I knew not where; For, so swiftly it flew, the sightCould not follow it in its flight.I breathed a song into the air,It fell to earth, I knew not where; For who has sight so keen and strong,That it can follow the flight of song? Long, long afterward, in an oakI found the arrow, still unbroke; And the song, from beginning to end,I found again in the heart of a friend. 
                        

                        <i>Translated into English in 1859 by Edward FitzGerald</i>I.Awake! for Morning in the Bowl of NightHas flung the Stone that puts the Stars to Flight:And Lo! the Hunter of the East has caughtThe Sultan's Turret in a Noose of Light. II.Dreaming when Dawn's Left Hand was in the SkyI heard a voice within the Tavern cry,'Awake, my Little ones, and fill the CupBefore Life's Liquor in its Cup be dry.' III.And, as the Cock crew, those who stood beforeThe Tavern shouted -  'Open then the Door! You know how little while we have to stay,And, once departed, may return no more.' IV.Now the New Year reviving old Desires,The thoughtful Soul to Solitude retires,Where the White Hand of Moses on the BoughPuts out, and Jesus from the Ground suspires. V.Iram indeed is gone with all its Rose,And Jamshyd's Sev'n-ring'd Cup where no one Knows; But still the Vine her ancient ruby yields,And still a Garden by the Water blows. VI.And David's Lips are lock't; but in divineHigh piping Pehlevi, with 'Wine! Wine! Wine! Red Wine! ' -  the Nightingale cries to the RoseThat yellow Cheek of hers to incarnadine. VII.Come, fill the Cup, and in the Fire of SpringThe Winter Garment of Repentance fling:The Bird of Time has but a little wayTo fly -  and Lo! the Bird is on the Wing. VIII.Whether at Naishapur or Babylon,Whether the Cup with sweet or bitter run,The Wine of Life keeps oozing drop by drop,The Leaves of Life kep falling one by one. IX.Morning a thousand Roses brings, you say; Yes, but where leaves the Rose of Yesterday? And this first Summer month that brings the RoseShall take Jamshyd and Kaikobad away. X.But come with old Khayyam, and leave the LotOf Kaikobad and Kaikhosru forgot:Let Rustum lay about him as he will,Or Hatim Tai cry Supper -  heed them not. XI.With me along the strip of Herbage strownThat just divides the desert from the sown,Where name of Slave and Sultan is forgot - And Peace is Mahmud on his Golden Throne! XII.A Book of Verses underneath the Bough,A Jug of Wine, a Loaf of Bread, -  and ThouBeside me singing in the Wilderness - Oh, Wilderness were Paradise now! XIII.Some for the Glories of This World; and someSigh for the Prophet's Paradise to come; Ah, take the Cash, and let the Promise go,Nor heed the rumble of a distant Drum! XIV.Were it not Folly, Spider-like to spinThe Thread of present Life away to win - What? for ourselves, who know not if we shallBreathe out the very Breath we now breathe in! XV.Look to the Rose that blows about us -  'Lo,Laughing,' she says, 'into the World I blow:At once the silken Tassel of my PurseTear, and its Treasure on the Garden throw.' XVI.The Worldly Hope men set their Hearts uponTurns Ashes -  or it prospers; and anon,Like Snow upon the Desert's dusty FaceLighting a little Hour or two -  is gone. XVII.And those who husbanded the Golden Grain,And those who flung it to the Winds like Rain,Alike to no such aureate Earth are turn'dAs, buried once, Men want dug up again. XVIII.Think, in this batter'd CaravanseraiWhose Doorways are alternate Night and Day,How Sultan after Sultan with his PompAbode his Hour or two and went his way. XIX.They say the Lion and the Lizard keepThe Courts where Jamshyd gloried and drank deep:And Bahram, that great Hunter -  the Wild AssStamps o'er his Head, but cannot break his Sleep. XX.I sometimes think that never blows so redThe Rose as where some buried Caesar bled; That every Hyacinth the Garden wearsDropt in its Lap from some once lovely Head. XXI.And this delightful Herb whose tender GreenFledges the River's Lip on which we lean - Ah, lean upon it lightly! for who knowsFrom what once lovely Lip it springs unseen! XXII.Ah, my Beloved, fill the Cup that clearsTo-day of past Regrets and future Fears - To-morrow? -  Why, To-morrow I may beMyself with Yesterday's Sev'n Thousand Years. XXIII.Lo! some we loved, the loveliest and bestThat Time and Fate of all their Vintage prest,Have drunk their Cup a Round or two before,And one by one crept silently to Rest. XXIV.And we, that now make merry in the RoomThey left, and Summer dresses in new Bloom,Ourselves must we beneath the Couch of EarthDescend, ourselves to make a Couch -  for whom? XXV.Ah, make the most of what we may yet spend,Before we too into the Dust descend; Dust into Dust, and under Dust, to lie; Sans Wine, sans Song, sans Singer, and -  sans End! XXVI.Alike for those who for To-day prepare,And those that after some To-morrow stare,A Muezzin from the Tower of Darkness cries'Fools! Your Reward is neither Here nor There! ' XXVII.Why, all the Saints and Sages who discuss'dOf the Two Worlds so learnedly, are thrustLike foolish Prophets forth; their Works to ScornAre scatter'd, and their Mouths are stopt with Dust. XXVIII.Oh, come with old Khayyam, and leave the WiseTo talk; one thing is certain, that Life flies; One thing is certain, and the Rest is Lies; The Flower that once has blown forever dies. XXIX.Myself when young did eagerly frequentDoctor and Saint, and heard great ArgumentAbout it and about; but evermoreCame out by the same Door as in I went. XXX.With them the Seed of Wisdom did I sow,And with my own hand labour'd it to grow:And this was all the Harvest that I reap'd - 'I came like Water and like Wind I go.' XXXI.Into this Universe, and Why not knowing,Nor Whence, like Water willy-nilly flowing:And out of it, as Wind along the Waste,I know not Whither, willy-nilly blowing. XXXII.Up from Earth's Centre through the Seventh GateI rose, and on the Throne of Saturn sate,And many Knots unravel'd by the Road; But not the Master-Knot of Human Fate. XXXIII.There was the Door to which I found no Key:There was the Veil through which I could not see:Some little talk awhile of Me and TheeThere was -  and then no more of Thee and Me. XXXIV.Then to the rolling Heav'n itself I cried,Asking, 'What Lamp had Destiny to guideHer little Children stumbling in the Dark? 'And -  'A blind Understanding! ' Heav'n replied. XXXV.Then to the Lip of this poor earthen UrnI lean'd, the secret Well of Life to learn:And Lip to Lip it murmur'd -  'While you live,Drink! -  for, once dead, you never shall return.' XXXVI.I think the Vessel, that with fugitiveArticulation answer'd, once did live,And merry-make, and the cold Lip I kiss'd,How many Kisses might it take -  and give! XXXVII.For in the Market-place, one Dusk of Day,I watch'd the Potter thumping his wet Clay:And with its all obliterated TongueIt murmur'd -  'Gently, Brother, gently, pray! ' XXXVIII.And has not such a Story from of OldDown Man's successive generations roll'dOf such a clod of saturated EarthCast by the Maker into Human mould? XXXIX.Ah, fill the Cup: -  what boots it to repeatHow Time is slipping underneath our Feet:Unborn To-morrow, and dead Yesterday,Why fret about them if To-day be sweet! XL.A Moment's Halt -  a momentary tasteOf Being from the Well amid the Waste - And Lo! the phantom Caravan has reach'dThe Nothing it set out from -  Oh, make haste! XLI.Oh, plagued no more with Human or Divine,To-morrow's tangle to itself resign,And lose your fingers in the tresses ofThe Cypress-slender Minister of Wine. XLII.Waste not your Hour, nor in the vain pursuitOf This and That endeavor and dispute; Better be merry with the fruitful GrapeThan sadden after none, or bitter, fruit. XLIII.You know, my Friends, with what a brave CarouseI made a Second Marriage in my house; Divorced old barren Reason from my Bed,And took the Daughter of the Vine to Spouse. XLIV.And lately, by the Tavern Door agape,Came stealing through the Dusk an Angel ShapeBearing a Vessel on his Shoulder; andHe bid me taste of it; and 'twas -  the Grape! XLV.The Grape that can with Logic absoluteThe Two-and-Seventy jarring Sects confute:The subtle Alchemest that in a TriceLife's leaden Metal into Gold transmute. XLVI.Why, be this Juice the growth of God, who dareBlaspheme the twisted tendril as Snare? A Blessing, we should use it, should we not? And if a Curse -  why, then, Who set it there? XLVII.But leave the Wise to wrangle, and with meThe Quarrel of the Universe let be:And, in some corner of the Hubbub couch'd,Make Game of that which makes as much of Thee. XLVIII.For in and out, above, about, below,'Tis nothing but a Magic Shadow-show,Play'd in a Box whose Candle is the Sun,Round which we Phantom Figures come and go. XLIX.Strange, is it not? that of the myriads whoBefore us pass'd the door of Darkness throughNot one returns to tell us of the Road,Which to discover we must travel too. L.The Revelations of Devout and Learn'dWho rose before us, and as Prophets burn'd,Are all but Stories, which, awoke from Sleep,They told their fellows, and to Sleep return'd. LI.Why, if the Soul can fling the Dust aside,And naked on the Air of Heaven ride,Is't not a shame -  Is't not a shame for himSo long in this Clay suburb to abide? LII.But that is but a Tent wherein may restA Sultan to the realm of Death addrest; The Sultan rises, and the dark FerrashStrikes, and prepares it for another guest. LIII.I sent my Soul through the Invisible,Some letter of that After-life to spell:And after many days my Soul return'dAnd said, 'Behold, Myself am Heav'n and Hell.' LIV.Heav'n but the Vision of fulfill'd Desire,And Hell the Shadow of a Soul on fire,Cast on the Darkness into which Ourselves,So late emerg'd from, shall so soon expire. LV.While the Rose blows along the River Brink,With old Khayyam and ruby vintage drink:And when the Angel with his darker DraughtDraws up to Thee -  take that, and do not shrink. LVI.And fear not lest Existence closing yourAccount, should lose, or know the type no more; The Eternal Saki from the Bowl has pour'dMillions of Bubbls like us, and will pour. LVII.When You and I behind the Veil are past,Oh but the long long while the World shall last,Which of our Coming and Departure heedsAs much as Ocean of a pebble-cast. LVIII.'Tis all a Chequer-board of Nights and DaysWhere Destiny with Men for Pieces plays:Hither and thither moves, and mates, and slays,And one by one back in the Closet lays. LIX.The Ball no Question makes of Ayes and Noes,But Right or Left, as strikes the Player goes; And he that toss'd Thee down into the Field,He knows about it all -  He knows -  HE knows! LX.The Moving Finger writes; and, having writ,Moves on: nor all thy Piety nor WitShall lure it back to cancel half a Line,Nor all thy Tears wash out a Word of it. LXI.For let Philosopher and Doctor preachOf what they will, and what they will not -  eachIs but one Link in an eternal ChainThat none can slip, nor break, nor over-reach. LXII.And that inverted Bowl we call The Sky,Whereunder crawling coop't we live and die,Lift not thy hands to it for help -  for ItRolls impotently on as Thou or I. LXIII.With Earth's first Clay They did the Last Man knead,And then of the Last Harvest sow'd the Seed:Yea, the first Morning of Creation wroteWhat the Last Dawn of Reckoning shall read. LXIV.Yesterday This Day's Madness did prepare; To-morrow's Silence, Triumph, or Despair:Drink! for you know not whence you came, nor why:Drink! for you know not why you go, nor where. LXV.I tell You this -  When, starting from the Goal,Over the shoulders of the flaming FoalOf Heav'n Parwin and Mushtari they flung,In my predestin'd Plot of Dust and Soul. LXVI.The Vine has struck a fiber: which aboutIf clings my Being -  let the Dervish flout; Of my Base metal may be filed a Key,That shall unlock the Door he howls without. LXVII.And this I know: whether the one True Light,Kindle to Love, or Wrath -  consume me quite,One Glimpse of It within the Tavern caughtBetter than in the Temple lost outright. LXVIII.What! out of senseless Nothing to provokeA conscious Something to resent the yokeOf unpermitted Pleasure, under painOf Everlasting Penalties, if broke! LXIX.What! from his helpless Creature be repaidPure Gold for what he lent us dross-allay'd - Sue for a Debt we never did contract,And cannot answer -  Oh the sorry trade! LXX.Nay, but for terror of his wrathful Face,I swear I will not call Injustice Grace; Not one Good Fellow of the Tavern butWould kick so poor a Coward from the place. LXXI.Oh Thou, who didst with pitfall and with ginBeset the Road I was to wander in,Thou will not with Predestin'd Evil roundEnmesh me, and impute my Fall to Sin? LXXII.Oh, Thou, who Man of baser Earth didst make,And who with Eden didst devise the Snake; For all the Sin wherewith the Face of ManIs blacken'd, Man's Forgiveness give -  and take! LXXIII.Listen again. One Evening at the CloseOf Ramazan, ere the better Moon arose,In that old Potter's Shop I stood aloneWith the clay Population round in Rows. LXXIV.And, strange to tell, among that Earthen LotSome could articulate, while others not:And suddenly one more impatient cried - 'Who is the Potter, pray, and who the Pot? ' LXXV.Then said another -  'Surely not in vainMy Substance from the common Earth was ta'en,That He who subtly wrought me into ShapeShould stamp me back to common Earth again.' LXXVI.Another said -  'Why, ne'er a peevish Boy,Would break the Bowl from which he drank in Joy; Shall He that made the vessel in pure LoveAnd Fancy, in an after Rage destroy? ' LXXVII.None answer'd this; but after Silence spakeA Vessel of a more ungainly Make:'They sneer at me for leaning all awry; What! did the Hand then of the Potter shake? ' LXXVIII:'Why,' said another, 'Some there are who tellOf one who threatens he will toss to HellThe luckless Pots he marred in making -  Pish! He's a Good Fellow, and 'twill all be well.' LXXIX.Then said another with a long-drawn Sigh,'My Clay with long oblivion is gone dry:But, fill me with the old familiar Juice,Methinks I might recover by-and-by! ' LXXX.So while the Vessels one by one were speaking,The Little Moon look'd in that all were seeking:And then they jogg'd each other, 'Brother! Brother! Now for the Porter's shoulder-knot a-creaking! ' LXXXI.Ah, with the Grape my fading Life provide,And wash my Body whence the Life has died,And in a Windingsheet of Vine-leaf wrapt,So bury me by some sweet Garden-side. LXXXII.That ev'n my buried Ashes such a SnareOf Perfume shall fling up into the Air,As not a True Believer passing byBut shall be overtaken unaware. LXXXIII.Indeed the Idols I have loved so longHave done my Credit in Men's Eye much wrong:Have drown'd my Honour in a shallow Cup,And sold my Reputation for a Song. LXXXIV.Indeed, indeed, Repentance oft beforeI swore -  but was I sober when I swore? And then, and then came Spring, and Rose-in-handMy thread-bare Penitence apieces tore. LXXXV.And much as Wine has play'd the Infidel,And robb'd me of my Robe of Honor -  well,I often wonder what the Vintners buyOne half so precious as the Goods they sell. LXXXVI.Alas, that Spring should vanish with the Rose! That Youth's sweet-scented Manuscript should close! The Nightingale that in the Branches sang,Ah, whence, and whither flown again, who knows! LXXXVII.Would but the Desert of the Fountain yieldOne glimpse -  If dimly, yet indeed, reveal'dTo which the fainting Traveller might spring,As springs the trampled herbage of the field! LXXXVIII.Ah Love! could thou and I with Fate conspireTo grasp this sorry Scheme of Things entire,Would not we shatter it to bits -  and thenRe-mould it nearer to the Heart's Desire! LXXXIX.Ah, Moon of my Delight who know'st no wane,The Moon of Heav'n is rising once again:How oft hereafter rising shall she lookThrough this same Garden after me -  in vain! XC.And when like her, oh Saki, you shall passAmong the Guests star-scatter'd on the Grass,And in your joyous errand reach the spotWhere I made one -  turn down an empty Glass! TAMAM SHUD 
                        

                        If you don't know the kind of person I amand I don't know the kind of person you area pattern that others made may prevail in the worldand following the wrong god home we may miss our star.For there is many a small betrayal in the mind,a shrug that lets the fragile sequence breaksending with shouts the horrible errors of childhoodstorming out to play through the broken dyke.And as elephants parade holding each elephant's tail,but if one wanders the circus won't find the park,I call it cruel and maybe the root of all crueltyto know what occurs but not recognize the fact.And so I appeal to a voice, to something shadowy,a remote important region in all who talk:though we could fool each other, we should consider--lest the parade of our mutual life get lost in the dark.For it is important that awake people be awake,or a breaking line may discourage them back to sleep;the signals we give--yes or no, or maybe--should be clear: the darkness around us is deep. 
                        

                        Three times I had the lust to kill,To clutch a throat so young and fair,And squeeze with all my might untilNo breath of being lingered there.Three times I drove the demon out,Though on my brow was evil sweat. . . .And yet I know beyond a doubtHe'll get me yet, he'll get me yet.I know I'm mad, I ought to tellThe doctors, let them care for me,Confine me in a padded cellAnd never, never set me free;But Oh how cruel that would be!For I am young - and comely too . . .Yet dim my demon I can see,And there is but one thing to do.Three times I beat the foul fiend back;The fourth, I know he will prevail,And so I'll seek the railway trackAnd lay my head upon the rail,And sight the dark and distant train,And hear its thunder louder roll,Coming to crush my cursed brain . . .Oh God, have mercy on my soul! 
                        

                        War broke: and now the Winter of the worldWith perishing great darkness closes in.The foul tornado, centred at Berlin,Is over all the width of Europe whirled,Rending the sails of progress. Rent or furledAre all Art's ensigns. Verse wails. Now beginFamines of thought and feeling. Love's wine's thin.The grain of human Autumn rots, down-hurled.For after Spring had bloomed in early Greece,And Summer blazed her glory out with Rome,An Autumn softly fell, a harvest home,A slow grand age, and rich with all increase.But now, for us, wild Winter, and the needOf sowings for new Spring, and blood for seed. 
                        

                        Great is the sun, and wide he goes Through empty heaven with repose; And in the blue and glowing days More thick than rain he showers his rays. Though closer still the blinds we pull To keep the shady parlour cool, Yet he will find a chink or two To slip his golden fingers through. The dusty attic spider-clad He, through the keyhole, maketh glad; And through the broken edge of tiles Into the laddered hay-loft smiles. Meantime his golden face around He bares to all the garden ground, And sheds a warm and glittering look Among the ivy's inmost nook. Above the hills, along the blue, Round the bright air with footing true, To please the child, to paint the rose, The gardener of the World, he goes. 
                        

                        Everyone grumbled.  The sky was grey. We had nothing to do and nothing to say. We were nearing the end of a dismal day, And there seemed to be nothing beyond,                      THEN          Daddy fell into the pond! And everyone's face grew merry and bright, And Timothy danced for sheer delight. 'Give me the camera, quick, oh quick! He's crawling out of the duckweed.' Click! Then the gardener suddenly slapped his knee, And doubled up, shaking silently, And the ducks all quacked as if they were daft And is sounded as if the old drake laughed. O, there wasn't a thing that didn't respond                       WHEN          Daddy fell into the pond! 
                        

                        A ghost, though invisible, still is like a placeyour sight can knock on, echoing; but herewithin this thick black pelt, your strongest gazewill be absorbed and utterly disappear:just as a raving madman, when nothing elsecan ease him, charges into his dark nighthowling, pounds on the padded wall, and feelsthe rage being taken in and pacified.She seems to hide all looks that have ever falleninto her, so that, like an audience,she can look them over, menacing and sullen,and curl to sleep with them. But all at onceas if awakened, she turns her face to yours;and with a shock, you see yourself, tiny,inside the golden amber of her eyeballssuspended, like a prehistoric fly. 
                        

                        You did not come,And marching Time drew on, and wore me numb.Yet less for loss of your dear presence thereThan that I thus found lacking in your makeThat high compassion which can overbearReluctance for pure lovingkindness' sakeGrieved I, when, as the hope-hour stroked its sum,You did not come. You love not me,And love alone can lend you loyalty;-I know and knew it. But, unto the storeOf human deeds divine in all but name,Was it not worth a little hour or moreTo add yet this: Once you, a woman, cameTo soothe a time-torn man; even though it beYou love not me. 
                        

                        I always like summer Best you can eat fresh corn From daddy's garden And okra And greens And cabbage And lots of Barbeque And buttermilk And homemade ice-cream At the church picnic And listen to Gospel music Outside At the church Homecoming And go to the mountains with Your grandmother And go barefooted And be warm All the time Not only when you go to bed And sleep 
                        

                        I am very bothered when I thinkof the bad things I have done in my life.Not least that time in the chemistry labwhen I held a pair of scissors by the bladesand played the handlesin the naked lilac flame of the Bunsen burner;then called your name, and handed them over. O the unrivalled stench of branded skinas you slipped your thumb and middle finger in,then couldn't shake off the two burning rings. Marked,the doctor said, for eternity.Don't believe me, please, if I saythat was just my butterfingered way, at thirteen,of asking you if you would marry me. 
                        

                        I woke before the morning, I was happy all the day, I never said an ugly word, but smiled and stuck to play. And now at last the sun is going down behind the wood, And I am very happy, for I know that I've been good. My bed is waiting cool and fresh, with linen smooth and fair, And I must be off to sleepsin-by, and not forget my prayer. I know that, till to-morrow I shall see the sun arise, No ugly dream shall fright my mind, no ugly sight my eyes. But slumber hold me tightly till I waken in the dawn, And hear the thrushes singing in the lilacs round the lawn. 
                        

                                      THE wild bee reels from bough to bough                With his furry coat and his gauzy wing.              Now in a lily-cup, and now                Setting a jacinth bell a-swing,                        In his wandering;              Sit closer love: it was here I trow                        I made that vow,              Swore that two lives should be like one                As long as the sea-gull loved the sea,              As long as the sunflower sought the sun,--                It shall be, I said, for eternity                        'Twixt you and me!              Dear friend, those times are over and done,                        Love's web is spun.              Look upward where the poplar trees                Sway and sway in the summer air,              Here in the valley never a breeze                Scatters the thistledown, but there                        Great winds blow fair              From the mighty murmuring mystical seas,                        And the wave-lashed leas.              Look upward where the white gull screams,                What does it see that we do not see?              Is that a star? or the lamp that gleams                On some outward voyaging argosy,--                        Ah! can it be              We have lived our lives in a land of dreams!                        How sad it seems.              Sweet, there is nothing left to say                But this, that love is never lost,              Keen winter stabs the breasts of May                Whose crimson roses burst his frost,                        Ships tempest-tossed              Will find a harbour in some bay,                        And so we may.              And there is nothing left to do                But to kiss once again, and part,              Nay, there is nothing we should rue,                I have my beauty,--you your Art,                        Nay, do not start,              One world was not enough for two                        Like me and you. 
                        

                        It lies not in our power to love or hate,For will in us is overruled by fate.When two are stripped, long ere the course begin,We wish that one should love, the other win;And one especially do we affectOf two gold ingots, like in each respect:The reason no man knows; let it sufficeWhat we behold is censured by our eyes.Where both deliberate, the love is slight:Who ever loved, that loved not at first sight? 
                        

                        'Twas mercy brought me from my Pagan land,Taught my benighted soul to understandThat there's a God, that there's a Saviour too:Once I redemption neither sought nor knew.Some view our sable race with scornful eye,"Their colour is a diabolic die."Remember, Christians, Negro's, black as Cain,May be refin'd, and join th' angelic train. 
                        

                        Today, from a distance, I saw youwalking away, and without a soundthe glittering face of a glacierslid into the sea. An ancient oakfell in the Cumberlands, holding onlya handful of leaves, and an old womanscattering corn to her chickens looked upfor an instant. At the other sideof the galaxy, a star thirty-five timesthe size of our own sun explodedand vanished, leaving a small green spoton the astronomer's retinaas he stood on the great open domeof my heart with no one to tell. 
                        

                        XLIIIHow do I love thee? Let me count the ways.I love thee to the depth and breadth and heightMy soul can reach, when feeling out of sightFor the ends of Being and ideal Grace.I love thee to the level of everyday'sMost quiet need, by sun and candle-light.I love thee freely, as men strive for Right;I love thee purely, as they turn from Praise.I love thee with the passion put to useIn my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith.I love thee with a love I seemed to loseWith my lost saints,—I love thee with the breath,Smiles, tears, of all my life!—and, if God choose,I shall but love thee better after death. 
                        

                        What thoughts I have of you tonight, Walt Whitman, for I walked down thestreets under the trees with a headache self-conscious looking at the full moon.In my hungry fatigue, and shopping for images, I went into the neon fruitsupermarket, dreaming of your enumerations!What peaches and what penumbras! Whole families shopping at night! Aislesfull of husbands! Wives in the avocados, babies in the tomatoes! --- and you,Garcia Lorca, what were you doing down by the watermelons?I saw you, Walt Whitman, childless, lonely old grubber, poking among themeats in the refrigerator and eyeing the grocery boys.I heard you asking questions of each: Who killed the pork chops? What pricebananas? Are you my Angel?I wandered in and out of the brilliant stacks of cans following you, andfollowed in my imagination by the store detective.We strode down the open corridors together in our solitary fancy tastingartichokes, possessing every frozen delicacy, and never passing the cashier.Where are we going, Walt Whitman? The doors close in an hour. Which way doesyour beard point tonight?(I touch your book and dream of our odyssey in the supermarket and feelabsurd.)Will we walk all night through solitary streets? The trees add shade toshade, lights out in the houses, we'll both be lonely.Will we stroll dreaming of the lost America of love past blue automobiles indriveways, home to our silent cottage?Ah, dear father, graybeard, lonely old courage-teacher, what America did youhave when Charon quit poling his ferry and you got out on a smoking bank andstood watching the boat disappear on the black waters of Lethe?

                        I was hoping to be happy by seventeen.School was a sharp check mark in the roll book,An obnoxious tuba playing at noon because our teamWas going to win at night. The teachers wereToo close to dying to understand. The hallwaysStank of poor grades and unwashed hair. Thus,A friend and I sat watching the water on Saturday,Neither of us talking much, just warming ourselvesBy hurling large rocks at the dusty groundAnd feeling awful because San Francisco was a postcardOn a bedroom wall. We wanted to go there, Hitchhike under the last migrating birdsAnd be with people who knew more than three chordsOn a guitar. We didn't drink or smoke,But our hair was shoulder length, wild whenThe wind picked up and the shadows ofThis loneliness gripped loose dirt. By bus or car,By the sway of train over a long bridge,We wanted to get out. The years frozeAs we sat on the bank. Our eyes followed the water,White-tipped but dark underneath, racing out of town. 
                        

                        Broad sun-stoned beaches.White heat.A green river.A bridge,scorched yellow palmsfrom the summer-sleeping housedrowsing through August.Days I have held,days I have lost,days that outgrow, like daughters,my harbouring arms. 
                        

                        I.Let's contend no more, Love,  Strive nor weep:All be as before, Love,  ---Only sleep!	II.What so wild as words are?  I and thouIn debate, as birds are,  Hawk on bough!	III.See the creature stalking  While we speak!Hush and hide the talking,  Cheek on cheek!	IV.What so false as truth is,  False to thee?Where the serpent's tooth is  Shun the tree---	V.Where the apple reddens  Never pry---Lest we lose our Edens,  Eve and I.	VI.Be a god and hold me  With a charm!Be a man and fold me  With thine arm!	VII.Teach me, only teach, Love  As I oughtI will speak thy speech, Love,  Think thy thought---	VIII.Meet, if thou require it,  Both demands,Laying flesh and spirit  In thy hands.	IX.That shall be to-morrow  Not to-night:I must bury sorrow  Out of sight:	X---Must a little weep, Love,  (Foolish me!)And so fall asleep, Love,  Loved by thee. 
                        

                        I shall die, but that is all that I shall do for Death.I hear him leading his horse out of the stall; I hear the clatter on the barn-floor.He is in haste; he has business in Cuba,business in the Balkans, many calls to make this morning.But I will not hold the bridlewhile he clinches the girth.And he may mount by himself: I will not give him a leg up. Though he flick my shoulders with his whip,I will not tell him which way the fox ran.With his hoof on my breast, I will not tell him where the black boy hides in the swamp.I shall die, but that is all that I shall do for Death;I am not on his pay-roll. I will not tell him the whereabout of my friends nor of my enemies either.Though he promise me much, I will not map him the route to any man's door.Am I a spy in the land of the living,that I should deliver men to Death?Brother, the password and the plans of our city are safe with me; never through me Shall you be overcome. 
                        

                        Seeing the snowman standing all aloneIn dusk and cold is more than he can bear.The small boy weeps to hear the wind prepareA night of gnashings and enormous moan.His tearful sight can hardly reach to whereThe pale-faced figure with bitumen eyesReturns him such a God-forsaken stareAs outcast Adam gave to paradise.The man of snow is, nonetheless, content,Having no wish to go inside and die.Still, he is moved to see the youngster cry.Though frozen water is his element,He melts enough to drop from one soft eyeA trickle of the purest rain, a tearFor the child at the bright pane surrounded bySuch warmth, such light, such love, and so much fear. 
                        

                        Rain, midnight rain, nothing but the wild rain On this bleak hut, and solitude, and me Remembering again that I shall die And neither hear the rain nor give it thanks For washing me cleaner than I have been Since I was born into this solitude. Blessed are the dead that the rain rains upon: But here I pray that none whom once I loved Is dying to-night or lying still awake Solitary, listening to the rain, Either in pain or thus in sympathy Helpless among the living and the dead, Like a cold water among broken reeds, Myriads of broken reeds all still and stiff, Like me who have no love which this wild rain Has not dissolved except the love of death, If love it be towards what is perfect and Cannot, the tempest tells me, disappoint. 
                        

                        these hips are big hips.they need space to move around in.they don't fit into littlepetty places. these hipsare free hips.they don't like to be held back.these hips have never been enslaved,they go where they want to go they do what they want to do. these hips are mighty hips.these hips are magic hips.i have known themto put a spell on a man and spin him like a top 
                        

                        Amazing grace! (how sweet the sound!) That sav'd a wretch like me!I once was lost, but now am found;Was blind, but now I see.'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear,And grace my fears reliev'd;How precious did that grace appear,The hour I first believ'd!Thro' many dangers, toils, and snares,I have already come;'Tis grace has brought me safe thus far,And grace will lead me home. The Lord has promis'd good to me,His word my hope secures;He will my shield and portion be,As long as life endures.Yes, when this flesh and heart shall fail, And mortal life shall cease;I shall possess, within the veil,A life of joy and peace.This earth shall soon dissolve like snow,The sun forbear to shine;But God, who call'd me here below,Will be for ever mine. 
                        

                        Deep in the man sits fast his fate To mould his fortunes, mean or great: Unknown to Cromwell as to me Was Cromwell's measure or degree; Unknown to him as to his horse, If he than his groom be better or worse. He works, plots, fights, in rude affairs, With squires, lords, kings, his craft compares, Till late he learned, through doubt and fear, Broad England harbored not his peer: Obeying time, the last to own The Genius from its cloudy throne. For the prevision is allied Unto the thing so signified; Or say, the foresight that awaits Is the same Genius that creates. 
                        

                        I have seemingly missed your words of love, Those  words that were written in the  sand And erased by the first wave.Do you remember, my love? I have enclosed  them  hermetically   With  that last kiss.And, after that, Another kiss And  another exotic beach And  another feeling,  autumnal feeling, Of another ostensible seemingly loveFulfilled my nothingness...Among corals and shells, Dried by the winds of the sea, I  awake in  following  my  lost steps, Taken by  the waves And redirected  to the great unknown in the sea, That great eternal.....I  still love you, I love you more, miss you more.Yes, I still miss  youAnd  I realize  that  all I can  do now Is to lodge near the  moan of  the sea sand, Which feels like  a silk slipped  worn-out  dress, When I touch it.And  slantingly  I elect the oblivion, When I want to kiss  again and againYour gray-haired temple, But, in reverting,   I receive only The kiss  of our child... 
                        

                        Though my mother was already two years deadDad kept her slippers warming by the gas,put hot water bottles her side of the bedand still went to renew her transport pass.You couldn't just drop in. You had to phone.He'd put you off an hour to give him time to clear away her things and look alone as though his still raw love were such a crime.He couldn't risk my blight of disbeliefthough sure that very soon he'd hear her keyscrape in the rusted lock and end his grief.He knew she'd just popped out to get the tea.I believe life ends with death, and that is all.You haven't both gone shopping; just the same,in my new black leather phone book there's your name and the disconnected number I still call.Submitted by Scott Dagostino 
                        

                        His vision, from the constantly passing bars,has grown so weary that it cannot holdanything else. It seems to him there area thousand bars; and behind the bars, no world.As he paces in cramped circles, over and over,the movement of his powerful soft stridesis like a ritual dance around a centerin which a mighty will stands paralyzed.Only at times, the curtain of the pupilslifts, quietly--. An image enters in,rushes down through the tensed, arrested muscles,plunges into the heart and is gone. 
                        

                        Although she feeds me bread of bitterness,And sinks into my throat her tiger's tooth,Stealing my breath of life, I will confessI love this cultured hell that tests my youth!Her vigor flows like tides into my blood,Giving me strength erect against her hate.Her bigness sweeps my being like a flood.Yet as a rebel fronts a king in state,I stand within her walls with not a shredOf terror, malice, not a word of jeer.Darkly I gaze into the days ahead,And see her might and granite wonders there,Beneath the touch of Time's unerring hand,Like priceless treasures sinking in the sand. 
                        

                        Barely a twelvemonth afterThe seven days war that put the world to sleep,Late in the evening the strange horses came.By then we had made our covenant with silence,But in the first few days it was so stillWe listened to our breathing and were afraid.On the second dayThe radios failed; we turned the knobs; no answer.On the third day a warship passed us, heading north,Dead bodies piled on the deck. On the sixth dayA plane plunged over us into the sea. ThereafterNothing. The radios dumb; And still they stand in corners of our kitchens,And stand, perhaps, turned on, in a million roomsAll over the world. But now if they should speak,If on a sudden they should speak again,If on the stroke of noon a voice should speak,We would not listen, we would not let it bringThat old bad world that swallowed its children quickAt one great gulp. We would not have it again.Sometimes we think of the nations lying asleep,Curled blindly in impenetrable sorrow,And then the thought confounds us with its strangeness.The tractors lie about our fields; at eveningThey look like dank sea-monsters couched and waiting.We leave them where they are and let them rust:'They'll molder away and be like other loam.'We make our oxen drag our rusty plows,Long laid aside. We have gone backFar past our fathers' land.And then, that eveningLate in the summer the strange horses came.We heard a distant tapping on the road,A deepening drumming; it stopped, went on againAnd at the corner changed to hollow thunder.We saw the headsLike a wild wave charging and were afraid.We had sold our horses in our fathers' timeTo buy new tractors. Now they were strange to usAs fabulous steeds set on an ancient shield.Or illustrations in a book of knights.We did not dare go near them. Yet they waited,Stubborn and shy, as if they had been sentBy an old command to find our whereaboutsAnd that long-lost archaic companionship.In the first moment we had never a thoughtThat they were creatures to be owned and used.Among them were some half a dozen coltsDropped in some wilderness of the broken world,Yet new as if they had come from their own Eden.Since then they have pulled our plows and borne our loadsBut that free servitude still can pierce our hearts.Our life is changed; their coming our beginning. 
                        

                        The love of field and coppice Of green and shaded lanes, Of ordered woods and gardens Is running in your veins. Strong love of grey-blue distance, Brown streams and soft, dim skies I know, but cannot share it, My love is otherwise. I love a sunburnt country, A land of sweeping plains, Of ragged mountain ranges, Of droughts and flooding rains. I love her far horizons, I love her jewel-sea, Her beauty and her terror The wide brown land for me! The stark white ring-barked forests, All tragic to the moon, The sapphire-misted mountains, The hot gold hush of noon, Green tangle of the brushes Where lithe lianas coil, And orchids deck the tree-tops, And ferns the warm dark soil. Core of my heart, my country! Her pitiless blue sky, When, sick at heart, around us We see the cattle die But then the grey clouds gather, And we can bless again The drumming of an army, The steady soaking rain. Core of my heart, my country! Land of the rainbow gold, For flood and fire and famine She pays us back threefold. Over the thirsty paddocks, Watch, after many days, The filmy veil of greenness That thickens as we gaze ... An opal-hearted country, A wilful, lavish land All you who have not loved her, You will not understand though Earth holds many splendours, Wherever I may die, I know to what brown country My homing thoughts will fly. ** 
                        

                        Escape me?Never---Beloved!While I am I, and you are you,  So long as the world contains us both,  Me the loving and you the lothWhile the one eludes, must the other pursue. My life is a fault at last, I fear:  It seems too much like a fate, indeed!  Though I do my best I shall scarce succeed.But what if I fail of my purpose here?It is but to keep the nerves at strain,  To dry one's eyes and laugh at a fall,And, baffled, get up and begin again,---  So the chace takes up one's life ' that's all. While, look but once from your farthest bound  At me so deep in the dust and dark,No sooner the old hope goes to ground  Than a new one, straight to the self-same mark,I shape me---EverRemoved! 
                        

                        Who played with a Dangerous Toy, and suffered a Catastrophe of considerable DimensionsWhen George's Grandmamma was toldThat George had been as good as gold,She promised in the afternoonTo buy him an Immense BALLOON.And so she did; but when it came,It got into the candle flame,And being of a dangerous sortExploded with a loud report!The lights went out! The windows broke!The room was filled with reeking smoke.And in the darkness shrieks and yellsWere mingled with electric bells,And falling masonry and groans,And crunching, as of broken bones,And dreadful shrieks, when, worst of all,The house itself began to fall!It tottered, shuddering to and fro,Then crashed into the street below-Which happened to be Savile Row.When help arrived, among the deadWere Cousin Mary, Little Fred,The Footmen (both of them), the Groom,The man that cleaned the Billiard-Room,The Chaplain, and the Still-Room Maid.And I am dreadfully afraidThat Monsieur Champignon, the Chef,Will now be permanently deaf-And both his aides are much the same;While George, who was in part to blame,Received, you will regret to hear,A nasty lump behind the ear.Moral:The moral is that little boysShould not be given dangerous toys. 
                        

                        Some one came knockingAt my wee, small door;Someone came knocking;I'm sure-sure-sure;I listened, I opened,I looked to left and right,But nought there was a stirringIn the still dark night;Only the busy beetleTap-tapping in the wall,Only from the forestThe screech-owl's call,Only the cricket whistlingWhile the dewdrops fall,So I know not who came knocking,At all, at all, at all.


                        Sometimes I can almost see, around our heads,Like gnats around a streetlight in summer,The children we could have,The glimmer of them.Sometimes I feel them waiting, dozing In some antechamber - servants, half-Listening for the bell. Sometimes I see them lying like love lettersIn the Dead Letter OfficeAnd sometimes, like tonight, by some blackSecond sight I can feel just one of themStanding on the edge of a cliff by the sea In the dark, stretching its arms out Desperately to me. 
                        

                        What is it to grow old?Is it to lose the glory of the form,The lustre of the eye?Is it for beauty to forego her wreath?Yes, but not for this alone.Is it to feel our strength -Not our bloom only, but our strength -decay?Is it to feel each limbGrow stiffer, every function less exact,Each nerve more weakly strung?Yes, this, and more! but not,Ah, 'tis not what in youth we dreamed 'twould be!'Tis not to have our lifeMellowed and softened as with sunset-glow,A golden day's decline!'Tis not to see the worldAs from a height, with rapt prophetic eyes,And heart profoundly stirred;And weep, and feel the fulness of the past,The years that are no more!It is to spend long daysAnd not once feel that we were ever young.It is to add, immuredIn the hot prison of the present, monthTo month with weary pain.It is to suffer this,And feel but half, and feebly, what we feel:Deep in our hidden heartFesters the dull remembrance of a change,But no emotion -none.It is -last stage of all -When we are frozen up within, and quiteThe phantom of ourselves,To hear the world applaud the hollow ghostWhich blamed the living man.

                        A moment of happiness,you and I sitting on the verandah,apparently two, but one in soul, you and I.We feel the flowing water of life here,you and I, with the garden's beautyand the birds singing.The stars will be watching us,and we will show themwhat it is to be a thin crescent moon.You and I unselfed, will be together,indifferent to idle speculation, you and I.The parrots of heaven will be cracking sugaras we laugh together, you and I.In one form upon this earth,and in another form in a timeless sweet land. 
                        

                        I take my wine jug out among the flowersto drink alone, without friends.I raise my cup to entice the moon.That, and my shadow, makes us three.But the moon doesn't drink,and my shadow silently follows.I will travel with moon and shadow,happy to the end of spring.When I sing, the moon dances.When I dance, my shadow dances, too.We share life's joys when sober.Drunk, each goes a separate way.Constant friends, although we wander,we'll meet again in the Milky Way.

                        And if it snowed and snow covered the drivehe took a spade and tossed it to one side.And always tucked his daughter up at nightAnd slippered her the one time that she lied. And every week he tipped up half his wage.And what he didn't spend each week he saved.And praised his wife for every meal she made.And once, for laughing, punched her in the face. And for his mum he hired a private nurse.And every Sunday taxied her to church.And he blubbed when she went from bad to worse.And twice he lifted ten quid from her purse. Here's how they rated him when they looked back:sometimes he did this, sometimes he did that. 
                        

                        I am your baby Mum.I did not come on my own Mum.God's angels flew down to your wombfrom the mighty heavensand placed me in your holy womb.I did not come on my own mum; God wanted it so.I was so happy in my new cave of love, in your holy womband slept there peacefully.The angles watched.They prayed to keep me safe alwaystill I will be born on the face of the earth.They practiced heavenly songs of birthto play on their golden harps on my birthday.When I was sleeping in your wombThe angels used to come to me.You did not know it, my dearest Mum.I was happy to be bornas your belovedchild.I wanted to smileI wanted to singI wanted to playI wanted to suck your breast milkUntil you were satisfied.I wanted to see the smile on your faceWhen I suck all your milk from your loving breasts. They were my dreams in your womb, Mum.But on a cruel dayyou decided to kill me.The devils in the Hadesheard about your decision.They brought the loudest drum, played in the devilish rhythms.All the devils came together, came and danced in circles, jumping and singing.They danced in lines.They danced in circles.They danced on the toes.They danced on their heads.They sang the wildest of songsand the devil drummers played.The whole hell was happythat you decided to kill me.You know how much I cried? You know how many angels cried? Do you know how the whole heaven criedon my day of death in your holy womb? A moment before i was cruelly murderedI saw the All-Powerful God crying helplessly. 
                        

                             If ever two were one, then surely we.      If ever man were lov'd by wife, then thee.      If ever wife was happy in a man,      Compare with me, ye women, if you can.      I prize thy love more than whole Mines of gold      Or all the riches that the East doth hold.      My love is such that Rivers cannot quench,      Nor ought but love from thee give recompetence.     Thy love is such I can no way repay.   The heavens reward thee manifold, I pray.    Then while we live, in love let's so persever   That when we live no more, we may live ever. 
                        

                        And the days are not full enoughAnd the nights are not full enoughAnd life slips by like a field mouse      Not shaking the grass 
                        

                        When Mother divorced you, we were glad. She took it andtook it in silence, all those years and thenkicked you out, suddenly, and herkids loved it. Then you were fired, and wegrinned inside, the way people grinned whenNixon's helicopter lifted off the SouthLawn for the last time. We were tickledto think of your office taken away, your secretaries taken away, your lunches with three double bourbons, your pencils, your reams of paper. Would they take yoursuits back, too, those darkcarcasses hung in your closet, and the blacknoses of your shoes with their large pores? She had taught us to take it, to hate you and take ituntil we pricked with her for your annihilation, Father. Now Ipass the bums in doorways, the whiteslugs of their bodies gleaming through slits in theirsuits of compressed silt, the stainedflippers of their hands, the underwaterfire of their eyes, ships gone down with thelanterns lit, and I wonder who took it and took it from them in silence until they hadgiven it all away and had nothing left but this. 
                        

                        Where sunless rivers weep     Their waves into the deep,     She sleeps a charmed sleep:         Awake her not.     Led by a single star,     She came from very far     To seek where shadows are         Her pleasant lot.     She left the rosy morn,   She left the fields of corn,   For twilight cold and lorn       And water springs.   Through sleep, as through a veil,   She sees the sky look pale,   And hears the nightingale       That sadly sings.   Rest, rest, a perfect rest   Shed over brow and breast;   Her face is toward the west,       The purple land.   She cannot see the grain   Ripening on hill and plain;   She cannot feel the rain       Upon her hand.   Rest, rest, for evermore   Upon a mossy shore;   Rest, rest at the heart's core       Till time shall cease:   Sleep that no pain shall wake;   Night that no morn shall break   Till joy shall overtake       Her perfect peace. 
                        

                        Love is not all: it is not meat nor drinkNor slumber nor a roof against the rain; Nor yet a floating spar to men that sink And rise and sink and rise and sink again; Love can not fill the thickened lung with breath, Nor clean the blood, nor set the fractured bone; Yet many a man is making friends with death Even as I speak, for lack of love alone. It well may be that in a difficult hour, Pinned down by pain and moaning for release, Or nagged by want past resolution's power, I might be driven to sell your love for peace, Or trade the memory of this night for food. It well may be. I do not think I would. 
                        

                        Dance me to your beauty with a burning violin Dance me through the panic 'til I'm gathered safely in Lift me like an olive branch and be my homeward dove Dance me to the end of love Dance me to the end of love 
                        

                        Traveling through the dark I found a deerdead on the edge of the Wilson River road.It is usually best to roll them into the canyon:that road is narrow; to swerve might make more dead.By glow of the tail-light I stumbled back of the carand stood by the heap, a doe, a recent killing;she had stiffened already, almost cold.I dragged her off; she was large in the belly.My fingers touching her side brought me the reason--her side was warm; her fawn lay there waiting,alive, still, never to be born.Beside that mountain road I hesitated.The car aimed ahead its lowered parking lights;under the hood purred the steady engine.I stood in the glare of the warm exhaust turning red;around our group I could hear the wilderness listen.I thought hard for us all--my only swerving--,then pushed her over the edge into the river. 
                        

                        Arithmetic is where numbers fly like pigeons in and out of your    head.Arithmet ic tell you how many you lose or win if you know how    many you had before you lost or won.Arithmetic is seven eleven all good children go to heaven -- or five    six bundle of sticks.Arithmetic is numbers you squeeze from your head to your hand    to your pencil to your paper till you get the answer.Arithmetic is where the answer is right and everything is nice and    you can look out of the window and see the blue sky -- or the    answer is wrong and you have to start all over and try again    and see how it comes out this time.If you take a number and double it and double it again and then    double it a few more times, the number gets bigger and bigger    and goes higher and higher and only arithmetic can tell you    what the number is when you decide to quit doubling.Arithmetic is where you have to multiply -- and you carry the    multiplication table in your head and hope you won't lose it.If you have two animal crackers, one good and one bad, and you    eat one and a striped zebra with streaks all over him eats the    other, how many animal crackers will you have if somebody    offers you five six seven and you say No no no and you say    Nay nay nay and you say Nix nix nix?If you ask your mother for one fried egg for breakfast and she    gives you two fried eggs and you eat both of them, who is    better in arithmetic, you or your mother?  
                        

                        Oh it's so easy to say -'Give what you think you lack -You feel unloved? Then give love, and love, and love...'...On the other hand -Do you have any better advice? 
                        

                        Here dead we lie Because we did not choose To live and shame the land From which we sprung. Life, to be sure,  Is nothing much to lose, But young men think it is, And we were young. 
                        

                        You lose your love for her and thenIt is her who is lost,And then it is both who are lost,And nothing is ever as perfect as you want it to be.In a very ordinary worldA most extraordinary pain mingles with the small routines,The loss seems huge and yetNothing can be pinned down or fully explained.You are afraid.If you found the perfect loveIt would scald your hands,Rip the skin from your nerves,Cause havoc with a computered heart.You lose your love for her and then it is her who is lost.You tried not to hurt and yetEverything you touched became a wound.You tried to mend what cannot be mended,You tried, neither foolish nor clumsy,To rescue what cannot be rescued.You failed,And now she is elsewhereAnd her night and your nightAre both utterly drained.How easy it would beIf love could be brought home like a lost kittenOr gathered in like strawberries,How lovely it would be; But nothing is ever as perfect as you want it to be. 
                        

                        R. L. StevensonNow there is nothing wrong with meExcept -- I think it's called T.B.And that is why I have to layOut in the garden all the day.Our garden is not very wideAnd cars go by on either side,And make an angry-hooty noiseThat rather startles little boys.But worst of all is when they takeMe out in cars that growl and shake,With charabancs so dreadful-nearI have to shut my eyes for fear.But when I'm on my back again,I watch the Croydon aeroplaneThat flies across to France, and singsLike hitting thick piano-strings.When I am strong enough to doThe things I'm truly wishful to,I'll never use a car or trainBut always have an aeroplane;And just go zooming round and round,And frighten Nursey with the sound,And see the angel-side of clouds,And spit on all those motor-crowds! 
                        

                        And then the day came,when the riskto remain tightin a budwas more painfulthan the riskit tookto Blossom. 
                        

                        Two crowned Kings, and One that stood aloneWith no green weight of laurels round his head,But with sad eyes as one uncomforted,And wearied with man's never-ceasing moanFor sins no bleating victim can atone,And sweet long lips with tears and kisses fed.Girt was he in a garment black and red,And at his feet I marked a broken stoneWhich sent up lilies, dove-like, to his knees.Now at their sight, my heart being lit with flame,I cried to Beatrice, 'Who are these? 'And she made answer, knowing well each name,'AEschylos first, the second Sophokles,And last (wide stream of tears!)  Euripides.' 
                        

                        Lost in a world, that scares me to death, Lost in a crowd, I'm losing my breath.Lost as a boy, lost as a man, I need to grow up, don't think I can.Lost as a person, can't find my way.Lost in life, every day.Lost in worry, who am I? All my life, I've lived a lie.Lost to kindness, lost to love, Lost in a sky, like a new-born dove.Lost in thought, which I shouldn't do, It winds me up, I can’t get through.Lost to comfort, all kind words, Lost to advice, it isn't heard.Lost to those who really care, All these people, always there.Lost in me, I need a break, Lost in wonder, which road to take? Lost in a place I don't know well, Where are you now? There's no one to tell.Lost here, all alone, Lost apart from the mobile phone.Lost still, there are no calls.I'm struggling alone, to break these walls.Lost in mind, lost in soul, Lost memories, they're just a hole.Lost family, lost mate, Gone now, yet I'm full of hate.Lost in a straight world, and I am gay, Lost now, for what to say, Lost in boredom, think I'll leave.There's a lot in life I need to achieve. 
                        

                        Birds singing in the dark —Rainy dawn.

                        When you're up against a trouble,      Meet it squarely, face to face;    Lift your chin and set your shoulders,     Plant your feet and take a brace.   When it's vain to try to dodge it,     Do the best that you can do;   You may fail, but you may conquer,     See it through!    Black may be the clouds about you    And your future may seem grim,  But don't let your nerve desert you;    Keep yourself in fighting trim.  If the worst is bound to happen,    Spite of all that you can do,  Running from it will not save you,    See it through!   Even hope may seem but futile,    When with troubles you're beset,  But remember you are facing    Just what other men have met.  You may fail, but fall still fighting;    Don't give up, whate'er you do;  Eyes front, head high to the finish.    See it through! 
                        

                        Is there for honesty poverty That hings his head, an' a' that; The coward slave - we pass him by, We dare be poor for a' that! For a' that, an' a' that, Our toils obscure an' a' that, The rank is but the guinea's stamp, The man's the gowd for a' that.  What though on hamely fare we dine, Wear hoddin grey, an' a' that? Gie fools their silks, and knaves their wine, A man's a man for a' that. For a' that, an' a' that, Their tinsel show, an' a' that, The honest man, tho' e'er sae poor, Is king o' men for a' that.  Ye see yon birkie ca'd a lord, Wha struts, an' stares, an' a' that; Tho' hundreds worship at his word, He's but a coof for a' that. For a' that, an' a' that, His ribband, star, an' a' that, The man o' independent mind He looks an' laughs at a' that.  A price can mak a belted knight, A marquise, duke, an' a' that; But an honest man's aboon his might, Gude faith, he maunna fa' that! For a' that, an' a' that, Their dignities an' a' that, The pith o' sense, an' pride o' worth, Are higher rank than a' that.  Then let us pray that come it may, (As come it will for a' that,) That Sense and Worth, o'er a' the earth, Shall bear the gree, an' a' that. For a' that, an' a' that, That man to man, the world o'er, Shall brithers be for a' that. 
                        

                        There will come soft rain and the smell of the ground,And swallows circling with their shimmering sound; And frogs in the pools singing at night,And wild plum trees in tremulous white; Robins will wear their feathery fire,Whistling their whims on a low fence-wire; And not one will know of the war, not oneWill care at last when it is done.Not one would mind, neither bird nor tree,If mankind perished utterly; And Spring herself, when she woke at dawnWould scarcely know that we were gone. 
                        

                        There was movement at the station, for the word had passed around That the colt from old Regret had got away, And had joined the wild bush horses - he was worth a thousand pound, So all the cracks had gathered to the fray. All the tried and noted riders from the stations near and far Had mustered at the homestead overnight, For the bushmen love hard riding where the wild bush horses are, And the stock-horse snuffs the battle with delight. There was Harrison, who made his pile when Pardon won the cup, The old man with his hair as white as snow; But few could ride beside him when his blood was fairly up- He would go wherever horse and man could go. And Clancy of the Overflow came down to lend a hand, No better horseman ever held the reins; For never horse could throw him while the saddle girths would stand, He learnt to ride while droving on the plains. And one was there, a stripling on a small and weedy beast, He was something like a racehorse undersized, With a touch of Timor pony - three parts thoroughbred at least - And such as are by mountain horsemen prized. He was hard and tough and wiry - just the sort that won't say die - There was courage in his quick impatient tread; And he bore the badge of gameness in his bright and fiery eye, And the proud and lofty carriage of his head. But so slight and weedy, one would doubt his power to stay, And the old man said, "That horse will never do For a long and tiring gallop-lad, you'd better stop away, Those hills are far too rough for such as you." So he waited sad and wistful - only Clancy stood his friend - "I think we ought to let him come," he said; "I warrant he'll be with us when he's wanted at the end, For both his horse and he are mountain bred." "He hails from Snowy River, up by Kosciusko's side, Where the hills are twice as steep and twice as rough, Where a horse's hoofs strike firelight from the flint stones every stride, The man that holds his own is good enough. And the Snowy River riders on the mountains make their home, Where the river runs those giant hills between; I have seen full many horsemen since I first commenced to roam, But nowhere yet such horsemen have I seen." So he went - they found the horses by the big mimosa clump - They raced away towards the mountain's brow, And the old man gave his orders, "Boys, go at them from the jump, No use to try for fancy riding now. And, Clancy, you must wheel them, try and wheel them to the right. Ride boldly, lad, and never fear the spills, For never yet was rider that could keep the mob in sight, If once they gain the shelter of those hills." So Clancy rode to wheel them - he was racing on the wing Where the best and boldest riders take their place, And he raced his stockhorse past them, and he made the ranges ring With stockwhip, as he met them face to face. Then they halted for a moment, while he swung the dreaded lash, But they saw their well-loved mountain full in view, And they charged beneath the stockwhip with a sharp and sudden dash, And off into the mountain scrub they flew. Then fast the horsemen followed, where the gorges deep and black Resounded to the thunder of their tread, And the stockwhips woke the echoes, and they fiercely answered back From cliffs and crags that beetled overhead. And upward, ever upward, the wild horses held their sway, Were mountain ash and kurrajong grew wide; And the old man muttered fiercely, "We may bid the mob good day, No man can hold them down the other side." When they reached the mountain's summit, even Clancy took a pull, It well might make the boldest hold their breath, The wild hop scrub grew thickly, and the hidden ground was full Of wombat holes, and any slip was death. But the man from Snowy River let the pony have his head, And he swung his stockwhip round and gave a cheer, And he raced him down the mountain like a torrent down its bed, While the others stood and watched in very fear. He sent the flint stones flying, but the pony kept his feet, He cleared the fallen timbers in his stride, And the man from Snowy River never shifted in his seat - It was grand to see that mountain horseman ride. Through the stringybarks and saplings, on the rough and broken ground, Down the hillside at a racing pace he went; And he never drew the bridle till he landed safe and sound, At the bottom of that terrible descent. He was right among the horses as they climbed the further hill And the watchers on the mountain standing mute, Saw him ply the stockwhip fiercely, he was right among them still, As he raced across the clearing in pursuit. Then they lost him for a moment, where two mountain gullies met In the ranges, but a final glimpse reveals On a dim and distant hillside the wild horses racing yet, With the man from Snowy River at their heels. And he ran them single-handed till their sides were white with foam. He followed like a bloodhound in their track, Till they halted cowed and beaten, then he turned their heads for home, And alone and unassisted brought them back. But his hardy mountain pony he could scarcely raise a trot, He was blood from hip to shoulder from the spur; But his pluck was still undaunted, and his courage fiery hot, For never yet was mountain horse a cur. And down by Kosciusko, where the pine-clad ridges raise Their torn and rugged battlements on high, Where the air is clear as crystal, and the white stars fairly blaze At midnight in the cold and frosty sky, And where around The Overflow the reed beds sweep and sway To the breezes, and the rolling plains are wide, The man from Snowy River is a household word today, And the stockmen tell the story of his ride. 
                        

                        Here, this smudge of blood, Of a tender boy of eleven, Soaked thru the tarmac,  Yet to be dried, still wet and warm!  An innocent young lad, Fades-in my mind, Your bag! Your bag! Picking up a shopping bag, Shouting and chasing the biker, Who slings the bag into the crowd, And cruises at a high speed.Shouting repeatedly in vain,  Albeit he ran a bit far away from the crowd, Your Bag!  Your Bag! Still shouting...Oh! Sudden, the shopping bag explodesShredding in to pieces, the poor boy. Scattering around his fresh flesh all over."My son! "    "My son! " The horror stricken mother gasps.  Dreadfully aloud and running to the spot, Where her son has been ripped, Plight of the mother is tearful. Compassions and rancours surge up, Cries and sighs of the shocked crowd, aghast.Mother out of sense of mind, Insanely hasten gathering, Of her only beloved son's tender bod.Warm blood dripping fleshes, broken skul, Clasping to her bosom  "Oh! My Son,    My Son. 'Weeping and wailing with a grief uncontrollable, Caving into the pool of blood…sans...consciousness. …………………………………………………………………………………………………………A ppalling brutality and the terror, Of evil minds, will get over when? Open your eyes, empathize, NO reward of Heaven, for shedding the innocent blood.  NO reward of Heaven, for this distress of mothers.What remains is just this smudge of blood…  
                        

                        Sweet, I blame you not, for mine the fault was, had I not been made of common clayI had climbed the higher heights unclimbed yet, seen the fuller air, the larger day.From the wildness of my wasted passion I had struck a better, clearer song,Lit some lighter light of freer freedom, battled with some Hydra-headed wrong.Had my lips been smitten into music by the kisses that but made them bleed,You had walked with Bice and the angels on that verdant and enamelled meed.I had trod the road which Dante treading saw the suns of seven circles shine,Ay! perchance had seen the heavens opening, as they opened to the Florentine.And the mighty nations would have crowned me, who am crownless now and without name,And some orient dawn had found me kneeling on the threshold of the House of Fame.I had sat within that marble circle where the oldest bard is as the young,And the pipe is ever dropping honey, and the lyre's strings are ever strung.Keats had lifted up his hymeneal curls from out the poppy-seeded wine,With ambrosial mouth had kissed my forehead, clasped the hand of noble love in mine.And at springtide, when the apple-blossoms brush the burnished bosom of the dove,Two young lovers lying in an orchard would have read the story of our love;Would have read the legend of my passion, known the bitter secret of my heart,Kissed as we have kissed, but never parted as we two are fated now to part.For the crimson flower of our life is eaten by the cankerworm of truth,And no hand can gather up the fallen withered petals of the rose of youth.Yet I am not sorry that I loved you -ah! what else had I a boy to do? - For the hungry teeth of time devour, and the silent-footed years pursue.Rudderless, we drift athwart a tempest, and when once the storm of youth is past,Without lyre, without lute or chorus, Death the silent pilot comes at last.And within the grave there is no pleasure, for the blindworm battens on the root,And Desire shudders into ashes, and the tree of Passion bears no fruit.Ah! what else had I to do but love you? God's own mother was less dear to me,And less dear the Cytheraean rising like an argent lily from the sea.I have made my choice, have lived my poems, and, though youth is gone in wasted days,I have found the lover's crown of myrtle better than the poet's crown of bays. 
                        

                        The apparition of these faces in the crowd; petals on a wet, black bough. 
                        

                        It is in the small things we see it.The child's first step, as awesome as an earthquake.The first time you rode a bike, wallowing up the sidewalk.The first spanking when your heartwent on a journey all alone.When they called you crybabyor poor or fatty or crazyand made you into an alien, you drank their acidand concealed it.Later, if you faced the death of bombs and bulletsyou did not do it with a banner, you did it with only a hat tocomver your heart.You did not fondle the weakness inside youthough it was there.Your courage was a small coalthat you kept swallowing.If your buddy saved youand died himself in so doing, then his courage was not courage, it was love; love as simple as shaving soap.Later, if you have endured a great despair, then you did it alone, getting a transfusion from the fire, picking the scabs off your heart, then wringing it out like a sock.Next, my kinsman, you powdered your sorrow, you gave it a back ruband then you covered it with a blanketand after it had slept a whileit woke to the wings of the rosesand was transformed.Later, when you face old age and its natural conclusionyour courage will still be shown in the little ways, each spring will be a sword you'll sharpen, those you love will live in a fever of love, and you'll bargain with the calendarand at the last momentwhen death opens the back dooryou'll put on your carpet slippersand stride out. 
                        

                        Last night I saw youOn the waterfrontYou glanced at me And I looked your way! Our eyes locked togetherAnd your eyes shifted colorsAs they caught the lightInstalled at the waterfront! Though your alluring lipsWere sealedYet those lovely eyes spokeA thousand words...! The night was perfectWith star studded skyYou winked at meAnd snatched my heart right away! It was a wonderful momentOur hearts craved for a kiss With the blissEverything happenedIn just a wink of an eye! You were utterly crazyYour glance made me crazyWe were both swept awayBy this undefined ecstasyIn just a wink of an eye! We soared the inevitableWe could not resistThe high tides of emotionIt knocked us downTo the very end! Copyright 2018, Rose Marie Juan-Austin, All Rights Reserved 
                        

                        I am offering this poem to you,since I have nothing else to give.Keep it like a warm coat,when winter comes to cover you,or like a pair of thick socksthe cold cannot bite through,I love you,I have nothing else to give you,so it is a pot full of yellow cornto warm your belly in the winter,it is a scarf for your head, to wearover your hair, to tie up around your face,I love you,Keep it, treasure it as you wouldif you were lost, needing direction,in the wilderness life becomes when mature;and in the corner of your drawer,tucked away like a cabin or a hoganin dense trees, come knocking,and I will answer, give you directions,and let you warm yourself by this fire,rest by this fire, and make you feel safe,I love you,It's all I have to give,and it's all anyone needs to live,and to go on living inside,when the world outsideno longer cares if you live or die;remember,I love you. 
                        

                        Time wears her not; she doth his chariot guide; Mortality below her orb is placed. --Raleigh The full-orbed moon with unchanged ray Mounts up the eastern sky, Not doomed to these short nights for aye, But shining steadily. She does not wane, but my fortune, Which her rays do not bless, My wayward path declineth soon, But she shines not the less. And if she faintly glimmers here, And paled is her light, Yet alway in her proper sphere She's mistress of the night. 
                        

                        Lightly, O lightly we bear her along,She sways like a flower in the wind of our song;She skims like a bird on the foam of a stream,She floats like a laugh from the lips of a dream.Gaily, O gaily we glide and we sing,We bear her along like a pearl on a string.Softly, O softly we bear her along,She hangs like a star in the dew of our song;She springs like a beam on the brow of the tide,She falls like a tear from the eyes of a bride.Lightly, O lightly we glide and we sing,We bear her along like a pearl on a string. 
                        

                        WEAVERS, weaving at break of day, Why do you weave a garment so gay? . . . Blue as the wing of a halcyon wild, We weave the robes of a new-born child.Weavers, weaving at fall of night, Why do you weave a garment so bright? . . . Like the plumes of a peacock, purple and green, We weave the marriage-veils of a queen.Weavers, weaving solemn and still, What do you weave in the moonlight chill? . . . White as a feather and white as a cloud, We weave a dead man's funeral shroud. 
                        

                        The tires on my bike are flat.The sky is grouchy gray.At least it sure feels like thatSince Hanna moved away.Chocolate ice cream tastes like prunes.December's come to stay.They've taken back the Mays and JunesSince Hanna moved away.Flowers smell like halibut.Velvet feels like hay.Every handsome dog's a muttSince Hanna moved away.Nothing's fun to laugh about.Nothing's fun to play.They call me, but I won't come outSince Hanna moved away.

                        All through an empty place I go,And find her not in any room;The candles and the lamps I lightGo down before a wind of gloom. Thick-spraddled lies the dust about,A fit, sad place to write her nameOr draw her face the way she lookedThat legendary night she came.The old house crumbles bit by bit;Each day I hear the ominous thudThat says another rent is thereFor winds to pierce and storms to flood.My orchards groan and sag with fruit;Where, Indian-wise, the bees go round;I let it rot upon the bough;I eat what falls upon the ground.The heavy cows go laboringIn agony with clotted teats;My hands are slack; my blood is cold;I marvel that my heart still beats.I have no will to weep or sing,No least desire to pray or curse;The loss of love is a terrible thing;They lie who say that death is worse. 
                        

                        With this heart I'll meet you, With this heart I'll greet you, Anywhere you choose.With these hands I'll undress you, With these hands I'll caress you, Anytime you choose.With these arms I'll hold you, With these arms I'll enfold you, Anyplace you choose.With these lips I'll kiss you, With these lips I'll bliss you, Anyway you choose.With my love I'll adore you, With my love I'll amour you, Any moment you choose.With my eyes I'll wake you, With my eyes I'll make youDesire me, any day you choose.©   Ernestine Northover 
                        

                        They turn the water off, so I live without water,they build walls higher, so I live without treetops,they paint the windows black, so I live without sunshine,they lock my cage, so I live without going anywhere,they take each last tear I have, I live without tears,they take my heart and rip it open, I live without heart,they take my life and crush it, so I live without a future,they say I am beastly and fiendish, so I have no friends,they stop up each hope, so I have no passage out of hell,they give me pain, so I live with pain,they give me hate, so I live with my hate,they have changed me, and I am not the same man,they give me no shower, so I live with my smell,they separate me from my brothers, so I live without brothers,who understands me when I say this is beautiful?who understands me when I say I have found other freedoms?I cannot fly or make something appear in my hand,I cannot make the heavens open or the earth tremble,I can live with myself, and I am amazed at myself, my love, my beauty,I am taken by my failures, astounded by my fears,I am stubborn and childish,in the midst of this wreckage of life they incurred,I practice being myself,and I have found parts of myself never dreamed of by me,they were goaded out from under rocks in my heartwhen the walls were built higher,when the water was turned off and the windows painted black.I followed these signslike an old tracker and followed the tracks deep into myselffollowed the blood-spotted path,deeper into dangerous regions, and found so many parts of myself,who taught me water is not everything,and gave me new eyes to see through walls,and when they spoke, sunlight came out of their mouths,and I was laughing at me with them,we laughed like children and made pacts to always be loyal,who understands me when I say this is beautiful? 
                        

                        The time you won your town the raceWe chaired you through the market-place; Man and boy stood cheering by, And home we brought you shoulder-high. To-day, the road all runners come, Shoulder-high we bring you home, And set you at your threshold down, Townsman of a stiller town. Smart lad, to slip betimes awayFrom fields where glory does not stayAnd early though the laurel growsIt withers quicker than the rose. Eyes the shady night has shutCannot see the record cut, And silence sounds no worse than cheersAfter earth has stopped the ears: Now you will not swell the routOf lads that wore their honours out, Runners whom renown outranAnd the name died before the man. So set, before its echoes fade, The fleet foot on the sill of shade, And hold to the low lintel upThe still-defended challenge-cup. And round that early-laurelled headWill flock to gaze the strengthless dead, And find unwithered on its curlsThe garland briefer than a girl's. 
                        

Our Andy's gone to battle now  'Gainst Drought, the red marauder; Our Andy's gone with cattle now  Across the Queensland border.  He's left us in dejection now;  Our hearts with him are roving. It's dull on this selection now,  Since Andy went a-droving.  Who now shall wear the cheerful face  In times when things are slackest? And who shall whistle round the place  When Fortune frowns her blackest?  Oh, who shall cheek the squatter now  When he comes round us snarling? His tongue is growing hotter now  Since Andy cross'd the Darling.  The gates are out of order now,  In storms the `riders' rattle; For far across the border now  Our Andy's gone with cattle.  Poor Aunty's looking thin and white;  And Uncle's cross with worry; And poor old Blucher howls all night  Since Andy left Macquarie.  Oh, may the showers in torrents fall,  And all the tanks run over; And may the grass grow green and tall  In pathways of the drover;  And may good angels send the rain  On desert stretches sandy; And when the summer comes again  God grant 'twill bring us Andy. 
                        

                        All things bright and beautiful,      All creatures great and small,   All things wise and wonderful,     The Lord God made them all.   Each little flower that opens,      Each little bird that sings,   He made their glowing colours,     He made their tiny wings.   The rich man in his castle,     The poor man at his gate,   God made them, high or lowly,     And ordered their estate.      The purple-headed mountain,     The river running by,   The sunset, and the morning,     That brightens up the sky;    The cold wind in the winter,     The pleasant summer sun,   The ripe fruits in the garden,     He made them every one.   The tall trees in the greenwood,     The meadows where we play,   The rushes by the water,     We gather every day;--   He gave us eyes to see them,     And lips that we might tell,   How great is God Almighty,     Who has made all things well. 
                        

                        I have a friend who still believes in heaven.Not a stupid person, yet with all she knows, she literally talks to God.She thinks someone listens in heaven.On earth she's unusually competent.Brave too, able to face unpleasantness.We found a caterpillar dying in the dirt, greedy ants crawling over it.I'm always moved by disaster, always eager to oppose vitalityBut timid also, quick to shut my eyes.Whereas my friend was able to watch, to let events play outAccording to nature.  For my sake she intervenedBrushing a few ants off the torn thing, and set it downAcross the road.My friend says I shut my eyes to God, that nothing else explainsMy aversion to reality.  She says I'm like the child whoBuries her head in the pillowSo as not to see, the child who tells herselfThat light causes sadness-My friend is like the mother. Patient, urging meTo wake up an adult like herself, a courageous person-In my dreams, my friend reproaches me.  We're walkingOn the same road, except it's winter now;She's telling me that when you love the world you hear celestial music:Look up, she says. When I look up, nothing.Only clouds, snow, a white business in the treesLike brides leaping to a great height-Then I'm afraid for her; I see herCaught in a net deliberately cast over the earth-In reality, we sit by the side of the road, watching the sun set;From time to time, the silence pierced by a birdcall.It's this moment we're trying to explain, the factThat we're at ease with death, with solitude.My friend draws a circle in the dirt; inside, the caterpillar doesn't move.She's always trying to make something whole, something beautiful, an imageCapable of life apart from her.We're very quiet. It's peaceful sitting here, not speaking, The compositionFixed, the road turning suddenly dark, the airGoing cool, here and there the rocks shining and glittering-It's this stillness we both love.The love of form is a love of endings. 
                        

                        Happy the man, whose wish and careA few paternal acres bound,Content to breathe his native air,                                In his own ground.Whose heards with milk, whose fields with bread,Whose flocks supply him with attire,Whose trees in summer yield him shade,                                In winter fire.Blest! who can unconcern'dly findHours, days, and years slide soft away,In health of body, peace of mind,                                Quiet by day,Sound sleep by night; study and easeTogether mix'd; sweet recreation,And innocence, which most does please,                                With meditation.Thus let me live, unseen, unknown;Thus unlamented let me dye;Steal from the world, and not a stone                                Tell where I lye. 
                        

                        Purple as tulips in May, mauve into lush velvet, purple as the stain blackberries leave on the lips, on the hands, the purple of ripe grapes sunlit and warm as flesh. Every day I will give you a color, like a new flower in a bud vase on your desk. Every day I will paint you, as women color each other with henna on hands and on feet. Red as henna, as cinnamon, as coals after the fire is banked, the cardinal in the feeder, the roses tumbling on the arbor their weight bending the wood the red of the syrup I make from petals. Orange as the perfumed fruit hanging their globes on the glossy tree, orange as pumpkins in the field, orange as butterflyweed and the monarchs who come to eat it, orange as my cat running lithe through the high grass. Yellow as a goat's wise and wicked eyes, yellow as a hill of daffodils, yellow as dandelions by the highway, yellow as butter and egg yolks, yellow as a school bus stopping you, yellow as a slicker in a downpour. Here is my bouquet, here is a sing song of all the things you make me think of, here is oblique praise for the height and depth of you and the width too. Here is my box of new crayons at your feet. Green as mint jelly, green as a frog on a lily pad twanging, the green of cos lettuce upright about to bolt into opulent towers, green as Grand Chartreuse in a clear glass, green as wine bottles. Blue as cornflowers, delphiniums, bachelors' buttons. Blue as Roquefort, blue as Saga. Blue as still water. Blue as the eyes of a Siamese cat. Blue as shadows on new snow, as a spring azure sipping from a puddle on the blacktop. Cobalt as the midnight sky when day has gone without a trace and we lie in each other's arms eyes shut and fingers open and all the colors of the world pass through our bodies like strings of fire. 
                        

                        And God stepped out on space,And he looked around and said:I'm lonely--I'll make me a world.And far as the eye of God could seeDarkness covered everything,Blacker than a hundred midnightsDown in a cypress swamp.Then God smiled,And the light broke,And the darkness rolled up on one side,And the light stood shining on the other,And God said: That's good!Then God reached out and took the light in his hands,And God rolled the light around in his handsUntil he made the sun;And he set that sun a-blazing in the heavens.And the light that was left from making the sunGod gathered it up in a shining ballAnd flung it against the darkness,Spangling the night with the moon and stars.Then down betweenThe darkness and the lightHe hurled the world;And God said: That's good!Then God himself stepped down--And the sun was on his right hand,And the moon was on his left;The stars were clustered about his head,And the earth was under his feet.And God walked, and where he trodHis footsteps hollowed the valleys outAnd bulged the mountains up.Then he stopped and looked and sawThat the earth was hot and barren.So God stepped over to the edge of the worldAnd he spat out the seven seas--He batted his eyes, and the lightnings flashed--He clapped his hands, and the thunders rolled--And the waters above the earth came down,The cooling waters came down.Then the green grass sprouted,And the little red flowers blossomed,The pine tree pointed his finger to the sky,And the oak spread out his arms,The lakes cuddled down in the hollows of the ground,And the rivers ran down to the sea;And God smiled again, And the rainbow appeared,And curled itself around his shoulder.Then God raised his arm and he waved his handOver the sea and over the land,And he said: Bring forth! Bring forth!And quicker than God could drop his hand,Fishes and fowlsAnd beasts and birdsSwam the rivers and the seas,Roamed the forests and the woods,And split the air with their wings.And God said: That's good!Then God walked around,And God looked aroundOn all that he had made.He looked at his sun, And he looked at his moon,And he looked at his little stars;He looked on his worldWith all its living things,And God said: I'm lonely still.Then God sat down--On the side of a hill where he could think;By a deep, wide river he sat down;With his head in his hands,God thought and thought,Till he thought: I'll make me a man!Up from the bed of the riverGod scooped the clay;And by the bank of the riverHe kneeled him down;And there the great God AlmightyWho lit the sun and fixed it in the sky, Who flung the stars to the most far corner of the night,Who rounded the earth in the middle of his hand;This great God,Like a mammy bending over her baby,Kneeled down in the dustToiling over a lump of clayTill he shaped it in is his own image;Then into it he blew the breath of life,And man became a living soul.Amen.Amen. 
                        

                        Walking through a field with my little brother SethI pointed to a place where kids had made angels in the snow.For some reason, I told him that a troop of angelshad been shot and dissolved when they hit the ground.He asked who had shot them and I said a farmer.Then we were on the roof of the lake.The ice looked like a photograph of water.Why he asked. Why did he shoot them.I didn't know where I was going with this.They were on his property, I said.When it's snowing, the outdoors seem like a room.Today I traded hellos with my neighbor.Our voices hung close in the new acoustics.A room with the walls blasted to shreds and falling.We returned to our shoveling, working side by side in silence.But why were they on his property, he asked. 
                        

                        The Curfew tolls the knell of parting day,The lowing herd wind slowly o'er the lea,The plowman homeward plods his weary way,And leaves the world to darkness and to me.Now fades the glimmering landscape on the sight,And all the air a solemn stillness holds,Save where the beetle wheels his droning flight,And drowsy tinklings lull the distant folds;Save that from yonder ivy-mantled tow'rThe moping owl does to the moon complainOf such as, wand'ring near her secret bow'r,Molest her ancient solitary reign.Beneath those rugged elms, that yew-tree's shade,Where heaves the turf in many a mould'ring heap,Each in his narrow cell for ever laid,The rude Forefathers of the hamlet sleep.The breezy call of incense-breathing Morn,The swallow twitt'ring from the straw-built shed,The cock's shrill clarion, or the echoing horn,No more shall rouse them from their lowly bed.For them no more the blazing hearth shall burn,Or busy housewife ply her evening care:No children run to lisp their sire's return,Or climb his knees the envied kiss to share.Oft did the harvest to their sickle yield,Their furrow oft the stubborn glebe has broke:How jocund did they drive their team afield!How bow'd the woods beneath their sturdy stroke!Let not Ambition mock their useful toil,Their homely joys, and destiny obscure;Nor Grandeur hear with a disdainful smileThe short and simple annals of the poor.The boast of heraldry, the pomp of pow'r,And all that beauty, all that wealth e'er gave,Awaits alike th' inevitable hour:The paths of glory lead but to the grave.Nor you, ye Proud, impute to These the fault,If Memory o'er their Tomb no Trophies raise,Where through the long-drawn aisle and fretted vaultThe pealing anthem swells the note of praise.Can storied urn or animated bustBack to its mansion call the fleeting breath?Can Honour's voice provoke the silent dust,Or Flatt'ry soothe the dull cold ear of death?Perhaps in this neglected spot is laidSome heart once pregnant with celestial fire;Hands, that the rod of empire might have sway'd,Or waked to ecstasy the living lyre.But Knowledge to their eyes her ample pageRich with the spoils of time did ne'er unroll;Chill Penury repress'd their noble rage,And froze the genial current of the soul.Full many a gem of purest ray sereneThe dark unfathom'd caves of ocean bear:Full many a flower is born to blush unseen,And waste its sweetness on the desert air.Some village Hampden that with dauntless breastThe little tyrant of his fields withstood,Some mute inglorious Milton here may rest,Some Cromwell guiltless of his country's blood.Th' applause of list'ning senates to command,The threats of pain and ruin to despise,To scatter plenty o'er a smiling land,And read their history in a nation's eyes,Their lot forbade: nor circumscribed aloneTheir glowing virtues, but their crimes confined;Forbade to wade through slaughter to a throne,And shut the gates of mercy on mankind,The struggling pangs of conscious truth to hide,To quench the blushes of ingenuous shame,Or heap the shrine of Luxury and PrideWith incense kindled at the Muse's flame.Far from the madding crowd's ignoble strife,Their sober wishes never learn'd to stray;Along the cool sequester'd vale of lifeThey kept the noiseless tenor of their way.Yet ev'n these bones from insult to protectSome frail memorial still erected nigh,With uncouth rhymes and shapeless sculpture deck'd,Implores the passing tribute of a sigh.Their name, their years, spelt by th' unletter'd muse,The place of fame and elegy supply:And many a holy text around she strews,That teach the rustic moralist to die.For who, to dumb Forgetfulness a prey,This pleasing anxious being e'er resign'd,Left the warm precincts of the cheerful day,Nor cast one longing ling'ring look behind?On some fond breast the parting soul relies,Some pious drops the closing eye requires;Ev'n from the tomb the voice of Nature cries,Ev'n in our Ashes live their wonted Fires.For thee, who, mindful of th' unhonour'd dead,Dost in these lines their artless tale relate;If chance, by lonely contemplation led,Some kindred spirit shall inquire thy fate,Haply some hoary-headed Swain may say,'Oft have we seen him at the peep of dawnBrushing with hasty steps the dews awayTo meet the sun upon the upland lawn.'There at the foot of yonder nodding beechThat wreathes its old fantastic roots so high,His listless length at noontide would he stretch,And pore upon the brook that babbles by.'Hard by yon wood, now smiling as in scorn,Mutt'ring his wayward fancies he would rove,Now drooping, woeful wan, like one forlorn,Or crazed with care, or cross'd in hopeless love.'One morn I miss'd him on the custom'd hill,Along the heath and near his fav'rite tree;Another came; nor yet beside the rill,Nor up the lawn, nor at the wood was he;'The next with dirges due in sad arraySlow through the church-way path we saw him borne.Approach and read (for thou canst read) the layGraved on the stone beneath yon aged thorn:'THE EPITAPHHere rests his head upon the lap of EarthA Youth to Fortune and to Fame unknown.Fair Science frown'd not on his humble birth,And Melancholy mark'd him for her own.Large was his bounty, and his soul sincere,Heav'n did a recompense as largely send:He gave to Mis'ry all he had, a tear,He gain'd from Heav'n ('twas all he wish'd) a friend.No farther seek his merits to disclose,Or draw his frailties from their dread abode,(There they alike in trembling hope repose,)The bosom of his Father and his God.


                        Anger, as black as a hook, overtakes me. Each day, each Nazitook, at 8: 00 A.M., a babyand sauteed him for breakfastin his frying pan. And death looks on with a casual eyeand picks at the dirt under his fingernail. Man is evil, I say aloud.Man is a flowerthat should be burnt, I say aloud.Manis a bird full of mud, I say aloud. And death looks on with a casual eyeand scratches his anus. Man with his small pink toes, with his miraculous fingersis not a templebut an outhouse, I say aloud.Let man never again raise his teacup.Let man never again write a book.Let man never again put on his shoe.Let man never again raise his eyes, on a soft July night.Never. Never. Never. Never. Never.I say those things aloud. I beg the Lord not to hear. 
                        

                        THY various works, imperial queen, we see,  How bright their forms! how deck'd with pomp    by thee!Thy wond'rous acts in beauteous order stand,And all attest how potent is thine hand.  From Helicon's refulgent heights attend,Ye sacred choir, and my attempts befriend:To tell her glories with a faithful tongue,Ye blooming graces, triumph in my song.     Now here, now there, the roving Fancy flies,Till some lov'd object strikes her wand'ring eyes,Whose silken fetters all the senses bind,And soft captivity involves the mind.  Imagination! who can sing thy force?Or who describe the swiftness of thy course?Soaring through air to find the bright abode,Th' empyreal palace of the thund'ring God,We on thy pinions can surpass the wind,And leave the rolling universe behind:From star to star the mental optics rove,Measure the skies, and range the realms above.There in one view we grasp the mighty whole,Or with new worlds amaze th' unbounded soul.  Though Winter frowns to Fancy's raptur'd eyesThe fields may flourish, and gay scenes arise;The frozen deeps may break their iron bands,And bid their waters murmur o'er the sands.Fair Flora may resume her fragrant reign,And with her flow'ry riches deck the plain;Sylvanus may diffuse his honours round,And all the forest may with leaves be crown'd:Show'rs may descend, and dews their gems disclose,And nectar sparkle on the blooming rose.  Such is thy pow'r, nor are thine orders vain,O thou the leader of the mental train:In full perfection all thy works are wrought,And thine the sceptre o'er the realms of thought.Before thy throne the subject-passions bow,Of subject-passions sov'reign ruler thou;At thy command joy rushes on the heart,And through the glowing veins the spirits dart.  Fancy might now her silken pinions tryTo rise from earth, and sweep th' expanse on high:From Tithon's bed now might Aurora rise,Her cheeks all glowing with celestial dies,While a pure stream of light o'erflows the skies.The monarch of the day I might behold,And all the mountains tipt with radiant gold,But I reluctant leave the pleasing views,Which Fancy dresses to delight the Muse;Winter austere forbids me to aspire,And northern tempests damp the rising fire;They chill the tides of Fancy's flowing sea,Cease then, my song, cease the unequal lay. 
                        

                        Indeed indeed, I cannot tell, Though I ponder on it well, Which were easier to state, All my love or all my hate. Surely, surely, thou wilt trust me When I say thou dost disgust me. O, I hate thee with a hate That would fain annihilate; Yet sometimes against my will, My dear friend, I love thee still. It were treason to our love, And a sin to God above, One iota to abate Of a pure impartial hate. 
                        

                        ATTEND my lays, ye ever honour'd nine,Assist my labours, and my strains refine;In smoothest numbers pour the notes along,For bright Aurora now demands my song.  Aurora hail, and all the thousand dies,Which deck thy progress through the vaulted skies:The morn awakes, and wide extends her rays,On ev'ry leaf the gentle zephyr plays;Harmonious lays the feather'd race resume,Dart the bright eye, and shake the painted plume.  Ye shady groves, your verdant gloom displayTo shield your poet from the burning day:Calliope awake the sacred lyre,While thy fair sisters fan the pleasing fire:The bow'rs, the gales, the variegated skiesIn all their pleasures in my bosom rise.  See in the east th' illustrious king of day!His rising radiance drives the shades away--But Oh! I feel his fervid beams too strong,And scarce begun, concludes th' abortive song. 
                        

                        You may talk o' gin and beerWhen you're quartered safe out 'ere,An' you're sent to penny-fights an' Aldershot it;But when it comes to slaughterYou will do your work on water,An' you'll lick the bloomin' boots of 'im that's got it.Now in Injia's sunny clime,Where I used to spend my timeA-servin' of 'Er Majesty the Queen,Of all them blackfaced crewThe finest man I knewWas our regimental bhisti, Gunga Din.      He was "Din! Din! Din!  You limpin' lump o' brick-dust, Gunga Din!      Hi! slippery ~hitherao~!      Water, get it!  ~Panee lao~!                   [Bring water swiftly.]  You squidgy-nosed old idol, Gunga Din." The uniform 'e woreWas nothin' much before,An' rather less than 'arf o' that be'ind,For a piece o' twisty ragAn' a goatskin water-bagWas all the field-equipment 'e could find.When the sweatin' troop-train layIn a sidin' through the day,Where the 'eat would make your bloomin' eyebrows crawl,We shouted "Harry By!"           [Mr. Atkins's equivalent for "O brother."]Till our throats were bricky-dry,Then we wopped 'im 'cause 'e couldn't serve us all.      It was "Din! Din! Din!  You 'eathen, where the mischief 'ave you been?      You put some ~juldee~ in it                               [Be quick.]      Or I'll ~marrow~ you this minute                           [Hit you.]  If you don't fill up my helmet, Gunga Din!" 'E would dot an' carry oneTill the longest day was done;An' 'e didn't seem to know the use o' fear.If we charged or broke or cut,You could bet your bloomin' nut,'E'd be waitin' fifty paces right flank rear.With 'is ~mussick~ on 'is back,                               [Water-skin.]'E would skip with our attack,An' watch us till the bugles made "Retire",An' for all 'is dirty 'ide'E was white, clear white, insideWhen 'e went to tend the wounded under fire!      It was "Din! Din! Din!"  With the bullets kickin' dust-spots on the green.      When the cartridges ran out,      You could hear the front-files shout,  "Hi! ammunition-mules an' Gunga Din!" I shan't forgit the nightWhen I dropped be'ind the fightWith a bullet where my belt-plate should 'a' been.I was chokin' mad with thirst,An' the man that spied me firstWas our good old grinnin', gruntin' Gunga Din.'E lifted up my 'ead,An' he plugged me where I bled,An' 'e guv me 'arf-a-pint o' water-green:It was crawlin' and it stunk,But of all the drinks I've drunk,I'm gratefullest to one from Gunga Din.      It was "Din! Din! Din!  'Ere's a beggar with a bullet through 'is spleen;      'E's chawin' up the ground,      An' 'e's kickin' all around:  For Gawd's sake git the water, Gunga Din!" 'E carried me awayTo where a dooli lay,An' a bullet come an' drilled the beggar clean.'E put me safe inside,An' just before 'e died,"I 'ope you liked your drink", sez Gunga Din.So I'll meet 'im later onAt the place where 'e is gone --Where it's always double drill and no canteen;'E'll be squattin' on the coalsGivin' drink to poor damned souls,An' I'll get a swig in hell from Gunga Din!      Yes, Din! Din! Din!  You Lazarushian-leather Gunga Din!      Though I've belted you and flayed you,      By the livin' Gawd that made you,  You're a better man than I am, Gunga Din! 
                        

                        I am a little purple flowerMy petals so extremely smallI 've stood in the grass for many an hourEnjoying a breeze most of allBut, oh, what happened to my peers! Just yesterday, it moved me to tearsWhile the children of John were playing their gameMy peers were trampled to death, what a shameWhen just before that, some bigger flowers were damagedThe children were scolded badly by JohnBut when my brothers were ravagedIt was noticed, sadly, by noneToday, however, I had a reason to smileA nerd, or so he must beLooked at this little purplish flower, a whileAnd took a picture of meEven if tomorrow, to the worst of my fearsI have to die, as yesterday my peersI will do so happilysince someone has seen the beauty in me.

                        How pleasant to know Mr. Lear, Who has written such volumes of stuff. Some think him ill-tempered and queer, But a few find him pleasant enough. His mind is concrete and fastidious, His nose is remarkably big; His visage is more or less hideous, His beard it resembles a wig. He has ears, and two eyes, and ten fingers, (Leastways if you reckon two thumbs); He used to be one of the singers, But now he is one of the dumbs. He sits in a beautiful parlour, With hundreds of books on the wall; He drinks a great deal of marsala, But never gets tipsy at all. He has many friends, laymen and clerical, Old Foss is the name of his cat; His body is perfectly spherical, He weareth a runcible hat. When he walks in waterproof white, The children run after him so! Calling out, "He's gone out in his night- Gown, that crazy old Englishman, oh!" He weeps by the side of the ocean, He weeps on the top of the hill; He purchases pancakes and lotion, And chocolate shrimps from the mill. He reads, but he does not speak, Spanish, He cannot abide ginger beer; Ere the days of his pilgrimage vanish, How pleasant to know Mr. Lear! 
                        

                        Ere the birth of my life, if I wished it or noNo question was asked me--it could not be so !If the life was the question, a thing sent to tryAnd to live on be YES; what can NO be ? to die.     NATURE'S ANSWERIs't returned, as 'twas sent ? Is't no worse for the wear ?Think first, what you ARE ! Call to mind what you WERE !I gave you innocence, I gave you hope,Gave health, and genius, and an ample scope,Return you me guilt, lethargy, despair ?Make out the invent'ry ; inspect, compare !Then die--if die you dare ! 
                        

                        Between going and stayingthe day wavers,in love with its own transparency.The circular afternoon is now a baywhere the world in stillness rocks.All is visible and all elusive,all is near and can’t be touched.Paper, book, pencil, glass,rest in the shade of their names.Time throbbing in my temples repeatsthe same unchanging syllable of blood.The light turns the indifferent wallinto a ghostly theater of reflections.I find myself in the middle of an eye,watching myself in its blank stare.The moment scatters. Motionless,I stay and go: I am a pause. 
                        

                        I am alone, in spite of love,In spite of all I take and give—In spite of all your tenderness,Sometimes I am not glad to live.I am alone, as though I stoodOn the highest peak of the tired gray world,About me only swirling snow,Above me, endless space unfurled;With earth hidden and heaven hidden,And only my own spirit's prideTo keep me from the peace of thoseWho are not lonely, having died.

                        Who Slammed Doors For Fun And Perished MiserablyA trick that everyone abhorsIn little girls is slamming doors.A wealthy banker's little daughterWho lived in Palace Green, Bayswater(By name Rebecca Offendort),Was given to this furious sport.She would deliberately goAnd slam the door like billy-o!To make her uncle Jacob start.She was not really bad at heart,But only rather rude and wild;She was an aggravating child...It happened that a marble bustOf Abraham was standing justAbove the door this little lambHad carefully prepared to slam,And down it came! It knocked her flat!It laid her out! She looked like that.Her funeral sermon (which was longAnd followed by a sacred song)Mentioned her virtues, it is true,But dwelt upon her vices too,And showed the deadful end of oneWho goes and slams the door for fun.The children who were brought to hearThe awful tale from far and nearWere much impressed, and inly sworeThey never more would slam the door,-- As often they had done before.

                        I ask not that my bed of deathFrom bands of greedy heirs be free;For these besiege the latest breathOf fortune's favoured sons, not me.I ask not each kind soul to keepTearless, when of my death he hears;Let those who will, if any, weep!There are worse plagues on earth than tears.I ask but that my death may findThe freedom to my life denied;Ask but the folly of mankind,Then, at last, to quit my side.Spare me the whispering, crowded room,The friends who come, and gape, and go;The ceremonious air of gloom -All which makes death a hideous show!Nor bring, to see me cease to live,Some doctor full of phrase and fame,To shake his sapient head and giveThe ill he cannot cure a name.Nor fetch, to take the accustomed tollOf the poor sinner bound for death,His brother doctor of the soul,To canvass with official breathThe future and its viewless things -That undiscovered mysteryWhich one who feels death's winnowing wingsMust need read clearer, sure, than he!Bring none of these; but let me be,While all around in silence lies,Moved to the window near, and seeOnce more before my dying eyesBathed in the sacred dew of mornThe wide aerial landscape spread -The world which was ere I was born,The world which lasts when I am dead.Which never was the friend of one,Nor promised love it could not give,But lit for all its generous sun,And lived itself, and made us live.There let me gaze, till I becomeIn soul with what I gaze on wed!To feel the universe my home;To have before my mind -insteadOf the sick-room, the mortal strife,The turmoil for a little breath -The pure eternal course of life,Not human combatings with death.Thus feeling, gazing, let me growComposed, refreshed, ennobled, clear;Then willing let my spirit goTo work or wait elsewhere or here! 
                        

                        Time that is moved by little fidget wheels Is not my time, the flood that does not flow. Between the double and the single bell Of a ship's hour, between a round of bells From the dark warship riding there below, I have lived many lives, and this one life Of Joe, long dead, who lives between five bells. Deep and dissolving verticals of light Ferry the falls of moonshine down. Five bells Coldly rung out in a machine's voice. Night and water Pour to one rip of darkness, the Harbour floats In the air, the Cross hangs upside-down in water. Why do I think of you, dead man, why thieve These profitless lodgings from the flukes of thought Anchored in Time? You have gone from earth, Gone even from the meaning of a name; Yet something's there, yet something forms its lips And hits and cries against the ports of space, Beating their sides to make its fury heard. Are you shouting at me, dead man, squeezing your face In agonies of speech on speechless panes? Cry louder, beat the windows, bawl your name! But I hear nothing, nothing...only bells, Five bells, the bumpkin calculus of Time. Your echoes die, your voice is dowsed by Life, There's not a mouth can fly the pygmy strait - Nothing except the memory of some bones Long shoved away, and sucked away, in mud; And unimportant things you might have done, Or once I thought you did; but you forgot, And all have now forgotten - looks and words And slops of beer; your coat with buttons off, Your gaunt chin and pricked eye, and raging tales Of Irish kings and English perfidy, And dirtier perfidy of publicans Groaning to God from Darlinghurst. Five bells. Then I saw the road, I heard the thunder Tumble, and felt the talons of the rain The night we came to Moorebank in slab-dark, So dark you bore no body, had no face, But a sheer voice that rattled out of air (As now you'd cry if I could break the glass), A voice that spoke beside me in the bush, Loud for a breath or bitten off by wind, Of Milton, melons, and the Rights of Man, And blowing flutes, and how Tahitian girls Are brown and angry-tongued, and Sydney girls Are white and angry-tongued, or so you'd found. But all I heard was words that didn't join So Milton became melons, melons girls, And fifty mouths, it seemed, were out that night, And in each tree an Ear was bending down, Or something that had just run, gone behind the grass, When blank and bone-white, like a maniac's thought, The naphtha-flash of lightning slit the sky, Knifing the dark with deathly photographs. There's not so many with so poor a purse Or fierce a need, must fare by night like that, Five miles in darkness on a country track, But when you do, that's what you think. Five bells. In Melbourne, your appetite had gone, Your angers too; they had been leeched away By the soft archery of summer rains And the sponge-paws of wetness, the slow damp That stuck the leaves of living, snailed the mind, And showed your bones, that had been sharp with rage, The sodden ectasies of rectitude. I thought of what you'd written in faint ink, Your journal with the sawn-off lock, that stayed behind With other things you left, all without use, All without meaning now, except a sign That someone had been living who now was dead: "At Labassa. Room 6 x 8 On top of the tower; because of this, very dark And cold in winter. Everything has been stowed Into this room - 500 books all shapes And colours, dealt across the floor And over sills and on the laps of chairs; Guns, photoes of many differant things And differant curioes that I obtained..." In Sydney, by the spent aquarium-flare Of penny gaslight on pink wallpaper, We argued about blowing up the world, But you were living backward, so each night You crept a moment closer to the breast, And they were living, all of them, those frames And shapes of flesh that had perplexed your youth, And most your father, the old man gone blind, With fingers always round a fiddle's neck, That graveyard mason whose fair monuments And tablets cut with dreams of piety Rest on the bosoms of a thousand men Staked bone by bone, in quiet astonishment At cargoes they had never thought to bear, These funeral-cakes of sweet and sculptured stone. Where have you gone? The tide is over you, The turn of midnight water's over you, As Time is over you, and mystery, And memory, the flood that does not flow. You have no suburb, like those easier dead In private berths of dissolution laid - The tide goes over, the waves ride over you And let their shadows down like shining hair, But they are Water; and the sea-pinks bend Like lilies in your teeth, but they are Weed; And you are only part of an Idea. I felt the wet push its black thumb-balls in, The night you died, I felt your eardrums crack, And the short agony, the longer dream, The Nothing that was neither long nor short; But I was bound, and could not go that way, But I was blind, and could not feel your hand. If I could find an answer, could only find Your meaning, or could say why you were here Who now are gone, what purpose gave you breath Or seized it back, might I not hear your voice? I looked out my window in the dark At waves with diamond quills and combs of light That arched their mackerel-backs and smacked the sand In the moon's drench, that straight enormous glaze, And ships far off asleep, and Harbour-buoys Tossing their fireballs wearily each to each, And tried to hear your voice, but all I heard Was a boat's whistle, and the scraping squeal Of seabirds' voices far away, and bells, Five bells. Five bells coldly ringing out. Five bells. 
                        

                        Mother doesn't want a dog.Mother says they smell,And never sit when you say sit,Or even when you yell.And when you come home late at nightAnd there is ice and snow,You have to go back out becauseThe dumb dog has to go.Mother doesn't want a dog.Mother says they shed,And always let the strangers inAnd bark at friends instead,And do disgraceful things on rugs,And track mud on the floor,And flop upon your bed at nightAnd snore their doggy snore.Mother doesn't want a dog.She's making a mistake.Because, more than a dog, I thinkShe will not want this snake. 
                        

                        When I think of her sparkling faceAnd of her body that rocked this way and that,When I think of her laughter,Her jubilance that filled me,It’s a wonder I’m not gone mad.She is away and I cannot do what I want.Other faces pale when I get close.She is away and I cannot breathe her in.The space her leaving has createdI have attempted to fillWith bodies that numbed upon touching,Among them I expected her opposite,And found only forgeries.Her wholeness I know to be a fiction of my making,Still I cannot dismiss the longing for her;It is a craving for sensation new fleshCannot wholly calm or cancel,It is perhaps for more than her.At night above the parks the stars are swarming.The streets are thick with nostalgia;I move through senseless routine and insensitive chatterAs if her going did not matter.She is away and I cannot breathe her in.I am ill simply through wanting her. 
                        

                        Every old man I seeReminds me of my fatherWhen he had fallen in love with deathOne time when sheaves were gathered.That man I saw in Gardner StreetStumbled on the kerb was one,He stared at me half-eyed,I might have been his son.And I remember the musicianFaltering over his fiddleIn Bayswater, London,He too set me the riddle.Every old man I seeIn October-coloured weatherSeems to say to me:"I was once your father." 
                        

                        To and fro, to and froIn my little boat I goSailing far across the seaAll alone, just little me.And the sea is big and strongAnd the journey very long.To and fro, to and froIn my little boat I go.Sea and sky, sea and sky,Quietly on the deck I lie,Having just a little rest.I have really done my bestIn an awful pirate fight,But we cdaptured them all right.Sea and sky, sea and sky,Quietly on the deck I lie--Far away, far awayFrom my home and from my play,On a journey without endOnly with the sea for friendAnd the fishes in the sea.But they swim away from meFar away, far awayFrom my home and from my play.Then he cried "O Mother dear."And he woke and sat upright,They were in the rocking chair,Mother's arms around him--tight. 
                        

                        Why does a person fear? Why does he or she lose cheer? How does a person achieve? How does one get mischief? What is the aim of a life? Is the age sixty of a person ripe? Why does a person miscarry? Why does a person speculate fairy? How to survive in this earth? Can a person avoid rebirth? Many questions arises in person's mind, What are the solutions have to find? A person fears for his or her unjust work, Telling a lie leads him or her to murk.Virtuous qualities like truth and nonviolence Bring a person peace, bliss and silence.Noble works, hard labour, bring ascent for person, Meditation brings calmness and righteous action.Aim of life should be to do good for nation, And to do for soul will always be the notion.Night comes after day and vice versa is sure, Rebirth must come after death, action should be pure.God can solve each problem if we shall do well, Let's meditate him and save life from hood's tale. 
                        

                        Give all to love;Obey thy heart;Friends, kindred, days,Estate, good-fame,Plans, credit, and the Muse,-Nothing refuse.'Tis a brave master;Let it have scope:Follow it utterly,Hope beyond hope:High and more highIt dives into noon,With wing unspent,Untold intent;But it is a god,Knows its own path,And the outlets of the sky.It was not for the mean;It requireth courage stout,Souls above doubt,Valor unbending;It will reward,-They shall returnMore than they were,And ever ascending.Leave all for love;Yet, hear me, yet,One word more thy heart behoved,One pulse more of firm endeavor,-Keep thee today,To-morrow, forever,Free as an ArabOf thy beloved.Cling with life to the maid;But when the surprise,First vague shadow of surmiseFlits across her bosom youngOf a joy apart from thee,Free be she, fancy-free;Nor thou detain her vesture's hem,Nor the palest rose she flungFrom her summer diadem. 
                        

                        The world is charged with the grandeur of God.   It will flame out, like shining from shook foil;   It gathers to a greatness, like the ooze of oil Crushed. Why do men then now not reck his rod? Generations have trod, have trod, have trod;   And all is seared with trade; bleared, smeared with toil;   And wears man's smudge |&| shares man's smell: the soil Is bare now, nor can foot feel, being shod. And for all this, nature is never spent;   There lives the dearest freshness deep down things; And though the last lights off the black West went   Oh, morning, at the brown brink eastward, springs -- Because the Holy Ghost over the bent   World broods with warm breast |&| with ah! bright wings. 
                        

                        Call the roller of big cigars,The muscular one, and bid him whipIn kitchen cups concupiscent curds.Let the wenches dawdle in such dressAs they are used to wear, and let the boysBring flowers in last month's newspapers.Let be be finale of seem.The only emperor is the emperor of ice-cream.Take from the dresser of deal.Lacking the three glass knobs, that sheetOn which she embroidered fantails onceAnd spread it so as to cover her face.If her horny feet protrude, they comeTo show how cold she is, and dumb.Let the lamp affix its beam.The only emperor is the emperor of ice-cream. 
                        

                        Some time when the river is ice ask memistakes I have made. Ask me whetherwhat I have done is my life. Othershave come in their slow way intomy thought, and some have tried to helpor to hurt: ask me what differencetheir strongest love or hate has made.I will listen to what you say.You and I can turn and lookat the silent river and wait. We knowthe current is there, hidden; and thereare comings and goings from miles awaythat hold the stillness exactly before us.What the river says, that is what I say. 
                        

                        translated by Will KirklandThe moon came into the forgein her bustle of flowering nard.The little boy stares at her, stares.The boy is staring hard.In the shaken airthe moon moves her amrs,and shows lubricious and pure,her breasts of hard tin."Moon, moon, moon, run!If the gypsies come,they will use your heartto make white necklaces and rings.""Let me dance, my little one.When the gypsies come,they'll find you on the anvilwith your lively eyes closed tight."Moon, moon, moon, run!I can feelheir horses come.""Let me be, my little one,don't step on me, all starched and white!"Closer comes the the horseman,drumming on the plain.The boy is in the forge;his eyes are closed.Through the olive grovecome the gypsies, dream and bronze,their heads held high,their hooded eyes.Oh, how the night owl calls,calling, calling from its tree!The moon is climbing through the skywith the child by the hand.They are crying in the forge,all the gypsies, shouting, crying.The air is veiwing all, views all.The air is at the viewing.

                        Like a joy on the heart of a sorrow,   The sunset hangs on a cloud;A golden storm of glittering sheaves,Of fair and frail and fluttering leaves,   The wild wind blows in a cloud.Hark to a voice that is calling   To my heart in the voice of the wind:My heart is weary and sad and alone,For its dreams like the fluttering leaves have gone,   And why should I stay behind? 
                        

                        When you set out for Ithakaask that your way be long,full of adventure, full of instruction.The Laistrygonians and the Cyclops,angry Poseidon - do not fear them:such as these you will never findas long as your thought is lofty, as long as a rareemotion touch your spirit and your body.The Laistrygonians and the Cyclops,angry Poseidon - you will not meet themunless you carry them in your soul,unless your soul raise them up before you.Ask that your way be long.At many a Summer dawn to enterwith what gratitude, what joy -ports seen for the first time;to stop at Phoenician trading centres,and to buy good merchandise,mother of pearl and coral, amber and ebony,and sensuous perfumes of every kind,sensuous perfumes as lavishly as you can;to visit many Egyptian cities,to gather stores of knowledge from the learned.Have Ithaka always in your mind.Your arrival there is what you are destined for.But don't in the least hurry the journey.Better it last for years,so that when you reach the island you are old,rich with all you have gained on the way,not expecting Ithaka to give you wealth.Ithaka gave you a splendid journey.Without her you would not have set out.She hasn't anything else to give you.And if you find her poor, Ithaka hasn't deceived you.So wise you have become, of such experience,that already you'll have understood what these Ithakas mean.

                        Have you forgotten yet?...For the world's events have rumbled on since those gagged days,Like traffic checked while at the crossing of city-ways:And the haunted gap in your mind has filled with thoughts that flowLike clouds in the lit heaven of life; and you're a man reprieved to go,Taking your peaceful share of Time, with joy to spare.But the past is just the same--and War's a bloody game...Have you forgotten yet?...Look down, and swear by the slain of the War that you'll never forget.Do you remember the dark months you held the sector at Mametz--The nights you watched and wired and dug and piled sandbags on parapets?Do you remember the rats; and the stenchOf corpses rotting in front of the front-line trench--And dawn coming, dirty-white, and chill with a hopeless rain?Do you ever stop and ask, 'Is it all going to happen again?'Do you remember that hour of din before the attack--And the anger, the blind compassion that seized and shook you thenAs you peered at the doomed and haggard faces of your men?Do you remember the stretcher-cases lurching backWith dying eyes and lolling heads--those ashen-greyMasks of the lads who once were keen and kind and gay?Have you forgotten yet?...Look up, and swear by the green of the spring that you'll never forget. 
                        

                        Hog Butcher for the World, Tool Maker, Stacker of Wheat, Player with Railroads and the Nation's Freight Handler; Stormy, husky, brawling, City of the Big Shoulders: They tell me you are wicked and I believe them, for I have seen your painted women under the gas lamps luring the farm boys. And they tell me you are crooked and I answer: Yes, it is true I have seen the gunman kill and go free to kill again. And they tell me you are brutal and my reply is: On the faces of women and children I have seen the marks of wanton hunger. And having answered so I turn once more to those who sneer at this my city, and I give them back the sneer and say to them: Come and show me another city with lifted head singing so proud to be alive and coarse and strong and cunning. Flinging magnetic curses amid the toil of piling job on job, here is a tall bold slugger set vivid against the little soft cities; Fierce as a dog with tongue lapping for action, cunning as a savage pitted against the wilderness, Bareheaded, Shoveling, Wrecking, Planning, Building, breaking, rebuilding, Under the smoke, dust all over his mouth, laughing with white teeth, Under the terrible burden of destiny laughing as a young man laughs, Laughing even as an ignorant fighter laughs who has never lost a battle, Bragging and laughing that under his wrist is the pulse, and under his ribs the heart of the people, Laughing! Laughing the stormy, husky, brawling laughter of Youth, half-naked, sweating, proud to be Hog Butcher, Tool Maker, Stacker of Wheat, Player with Railroads and Freight Handler to the Nation. 
                        

                        See what delights in sylvan scenes appear! Descending Gods have found Elysium here. In woods bright Venus with Adonis stray'd, And chaste Diana haunts the forest shade. Come lovely nymph, and bless the silent hours, When swains from shearing seek their nightly bow'rs; When weary reapers quit the sultry field, And crown'd with corn, their thanks to Ceres yield. This harmless grove no lurking viper hides, But in my breast the serpent Love abides. Here bees from blossoms sip the rosy dew, But your Alexis knows no sweets but you. Oh deign to visit our forsaken seats, The mossy fountains, and the green retreats! Where-e'er you walk, cool gales shall fan the glade, Trees, where you sit, shall crowd into a shade, Where-e'er you tread, the blushing flow'rs shall rise, And all things flourish where you turn your eyes. Oh! How I long with you to pass my days, Invoke the muses, and resound your praise; Your praise the birds shall chant in ev'ry grove, And winds shall waft it to the pow'rs above. But wou'd you sing, and rival Orpheus' strain, The wond'ring forests soon shou'd dance again, The moving mountains hear the pow'rful call, And headlong streams hang list'ning in their fall! But see, the shepherds shun the noon-day heat, The lowing herds to murm'ring brooks retreat, To closer shades the panting flocks remove, Ye Gods! And is there no relief for Love? But soon the sun with milder rays descendsTo the cool ocean, where his journey ends; On me Love's fiercer flames for ever prey, By night he scorches, as he burns by day. 
                        

                        I come in from a walkWith youAnd they ask meIf it is raining.I didn’t noticeBut I’ll have to give them The right answerOr they’ll think I’m crazy. 
                        

                        Little Birds are diningWarily and well,Hid in mossy cell:Hid, I say, by waitersGorgeous in their gaiters -I've a Tale to tell.Little Birds are feedingJustices with jam,Rich in frizzled ham:Rich, I say, in oystersHaunting shady cloisters -That is what I am.Little Birds are teachingTigresses to smile,Innocent of guile:Smile, I say, not smirkle -Mouth a semicircle,That's the proper style!Little Birds are sleepingAll among the pins,Where the loser wins:Where, I say, he sneezesWhen and how he pleases -So the Tale begins.Little Birds are writingInteresting books,To be read by cooks:Read, I say, not roasted -Letterpress, when toasted,Loses its good looks.Little Birds are playingBagpipes on the shore,Where the tourists snore:"Thanks!" they cry. "'Tis thrilling!Take, oh take this shilling!Let us have no more!"Little Birds are bathingCrocodiles in cream,Like a happy dream:Like, but not so lasting -Crocodiles, when fasting,Are not all they seem!Little Birds are chokingBaronets with bun,Taught to fire a gun:Taught, I say, to splinterSalmon in the winter -Merely for the fun.Little Birds are hidingCrimes in carpet-bags,Blessed by happy stags:Blessed, I say, though beaten -Since our friends are eatenWhen the memory flags.Little Birds are tastingGratitude and gold,Pale with sudden cold:Pale, I say, and wrinkled -When the bells have tinkled,And the Tale is told.

                        The outlook wasn't brilliant for the Mudville nine that day; The score stood four to two, with but one inning more to play,And then when Cooney died at first, and Barrows did the same,A pall-like silence fell upon the patrons of the game. A straggling few got up to go in deep despair. The restClung to that hope which springs eternal in the human breast; They thought, 'If only Casey could but get a whack at that- We'd put up even money now, with Casey at the bat.' But Flynn preceded Casey, as did also Jimmy Blake,And the former was a hoodoo, while the latter was a cake; So upon that stricken multitude grim melancholy sat,For there seemed but little chance of Casey getting to the bat.But Flynn let drive a single, to the wonderment of all,And Blake, the much despisèd, tore the cover off the ball; And when the dust had lifted, and men saw what had occurred,There was Jimmy safe at second and Flynn a-hugging third. Then from five thousand throats and more there rose a lusty yell; It rumbled through the valley, it rattled in the dell; It pounded on the mountain and recoiled upon the flat,For Casey, mighty Casey, was advancing to the bat. There was ease in Casey's manner as he stepped into his place; There was pride in Casey's bearing and a smile lit Casey's face.And when, responding to the cheers, he lightly doffed his hat,No stranger in the crowd could doubt 'twas Casey at the bat. Ten thousand eyes were on him as he rubbed his hands with dirt; Five thousand tongues applauded when he wiped them on his shirt; Then while the writhing pitcher ground the ball into his hip,Defiance flashed in Casey's eye, a sneer curled Casey's lip. And now the leather-covered sphere came hurtling through the air,And Casey stood a-watching it in haughty grandeur there.Close by the sturdy batsman the ball unheeded sped- 'That ain't my style,' said Casey. 'Strike one! ' the umpire said. From the benches, black with people, there went up a muffled roar,Like the beating of the storm-waves on a stern and distant shore; 'Kill him! Kill the umpire! ' shouted some one on the stand; And it's likely they'd have killed him had not Casey raised his hand. With a smile of Christian charity great Casey's visage shone; He stilled the rising tumult; he bade the game go on; He signaled to the pitcher, and once more the dun sphere flew; But Casey still ignored it, and the umpire said, 'Strike two! ' 'Fraud! ' cried the maddened thousands, and echo answered 'Fraud! 'But one scornful look from Casey and the audience was awed.They saw his face grow stern and cold, they saw his muscles strain,And they knew that Casey wouldn't let that ball go by again. The sneer has fled from Casey's lip, his teeth are clenched in hate; He pounds with cruel violence his bat upon the plate.And now the pitcher holds the ball, and now he lets it go.And now the air is shattered by the force of Casey's blow. Oh, somewhere in this favored land the sun is shining bright; The band is playing somewhere, and somewhere hearts are light,And somewhere men are laughing, and little children shout; But there is no joy in Mudville- mighty Casey has struck out. 
                        

                        The little toy dog is covered with dust, But sturdy and stanch he stands;And the little toy soldier is red with rust, And his musket molds in his hands.Time was when the little toy dog was new And the soldier was passing fair,And that was the time when our Little Boy Blue Kissed them and put them there."Now, don't you go till I come," he said, "And don't you make any noise!"So toddling off to his trundle-bed He dreamed of the pretty toys.And as he was dreaming, an angel song Awakened our Little Boy Blue,--Oh, the years are many, the years are long, But the little toy friends are true.Ay, faithful to Little Boy Blue they stand, Each in the same old place,Awaiting the touch of a little hand, The smile of a little face.And they wonder, as waiting these long years through, In the dust of that little chair,What has become of our Little Boy Blue Since he kissed them and put them there. 
                        

                        If you want a lover I'll do anything you ask me to And if you want another kind of love I'll wear a mask for you If you want a partner Take my hand Or if you want to strike me down in anger Here I stand I'm your man 
                        

                        Your two great eyes will slay me suddenly;Their beauty shakes me who was once serene;Straight through my heart the wound is quick and keen. Only your word will heal the injuryTo my hurt heart, while yet the wound is clean -Your two great eyes will slay me suddenly;Their beauty shakes me who was once serene. Upon my word, I tell you faithfullyThrough life and after death you are my queen;For with my death the whole truth shall be seen.Your two great eyes will slay me suddenly;Their beauty shakes me who was once serene;Straight through my heart the wound is quick and keen.

The brooding ghosts of Australian night have gone from the bush and town; My spirit revives in the morning breeze,   though it died when the sun went down; The river is high and the stream is strong,   and the grass is green and tall, And I fain would think that this world of ours is a good world after all.  The light of passion in dreamy eyes, and a page of truth well read, The glorious thrill in a heart grown cold of the spirit I thought was dead, A song that goes to a comrade's heart, and a tear of pride let fall -- And my soul is strong! and the world to me is a grand world after all!  Let our enemies go by their old dull tracks,   and theirs be the fault or shame (The man is bitter against the world who has only himself to blame); Let the darkest side of the past be dark, and only the good recall; For I must believe that the world, my dear, is a kind world after all.  It well may be that I saw too plain, and it may be I was blind; But I'll keep my face to the dawning light,   though the devil may stand behind! Though the devil may stand behind my back, I'll not see his shadow fall, But read the signs in the morning stars of a good world after all.  Rest, for your eyes are weary, girl -- you have driven the worst away -- The ghost of the man that I might have been is gone from my heart to-day; We'll live for life and the best it brings till our twilight shadows fall; My heart grows brave, and the world, my girl, is a good world after all. 
                        

                        With promise of job, he lured her into a cane field.His gentleness a veil of sanity.Lurking in his mind, a perversion of sex instinct: 'Bind her! Torture her! Kill her! 'Deep within comfort zone suddenly brandishing his bludgeon, countenance wearing mercilessness - sight of which imported terror into her spine.Desperate plea for mercy fueling his excitement.Menacingly, her clothes he demanded.Hissing in agony like pine tree, gnashing her teeth before the incubus, she stripped.Her nudity assaulting his senses, eyes flaming with lust, he took stock of the bared flesh: 'Beautiful! Submissive! Horrified! 'Bound and gagged, fantasy translating into reality, all hell broke loose...Urge gratified, with her undergarment around her neck, he sealed her fate.Sixteenth victim of the unhinged mind: Single mother of two horrendously maimed.Not quite long, no sooner had he got home than long arm of the law tapped his shoulders: DNA found on victims had matched his.Karma forced to be lenient, he lives albeit in confinement.No Death Penalty In Mzansi.NOTE: Mzansi is the affectionate name for South Africa.The Phoenix Strangler - Sipho Mandla Agmatir Thwala (born 1968) is a South African rapist and serial killer. He began his year-long rape and murder spree in 1996. His modus operandi was to lure local women into accompanying him through the sugarcane field near the town of Phoenix in KwaZulu-Natal Providence with the promise of employment as domestic servants in hotels. Once they were deep within the cane field, Thwala would attack the women, bind them with their undergarments and then rape, strangle and bludgeon them to death. Afterwards, hoping to destroy any physical evidence of the attack, he would set fire to the cane fields.Thwala was arrested in 1997 after South African police matched DNA found on the victims to DNA taken from Thwala in 1994 when he was arrested and acquitted for a rape charge.On March 31,1999, the High Court in Durban found Thwala guilty of 16 murders and 10 rapes and sentenced him to 506 years in prison.Thwala is currently being held at CMax penitentiary in Pretoria South Africa.The picture displayed below is that of Sipho Mandla Agmatir Thwala -popularly referred to in South Africa as The Phoenix Strangler. 
                        

                        Had we but World enough, and Time,This coyness Lady were no crime.We would sit down, and think which wayTo walk, and pass our long Loves Day.Thou by the Indian Ganges side.Should'st Rubies find: I by the TideOf Humber would complain. I wouldLove you ten years before the Flood:And you should if you please refuseTill the Conversion of the Jews.My vegetable Love should growVaster then Empires, and more slow.An hundred years should go to praiseThine Eyes, and on thy Forehead Gaze.Two hundred to adore each Breast.But thirty thousand to the rest.An Age at least to every part,And the last Age should show your Heart.For Lady you deserve this State; Nor would I love at lower rate.But at my back I alwaies hearTimes winged Charriot hurrying near:And yonder all before us lyeDesarts of vast Eternity.Thy Beauty shall no more be found; Nor, in thy marble Vault, shall soundMy ecchoing Song: then Worms shall tryThat long preserv'd Virginity:And your quaint Honour turn to durst; And into ashes all my Lust.The Grave's a fine and private place,But none I think do there embrace.Now therefore, while the youthful hewSits on thy skin like morning glew,And while thy willing Soul transpiresAt every pore with instant Fires,Now let us sport us while we may; And now, like am'rous birds of prey,Rather at once our Time devour,Than languish in his slow-chapt pow'r.Let us roll all our Strength, and allOur sweetness, up into one Ball:And tear our Pleasures with rough strife,Thorough the Iron gates of Life.Thus, though we cannot make our SunStand still, yet we will make him run.

                        Not under foreign skiesNor under foreign wings protected -I shared all this with my own peopleThere, where misfortune had abandoned us. [1961]INSTEAD OF A PREFACEDuring the frightening years of the Yezhov terror, Ispent seventeen months waiting in prison queues inLeningrad. One day, somehow, someone 'picked me out'.On that occasion there was a woman standing behind me,her lips blue with cold, who, of course, had never inher life heard my name. Jolted out of the torporcharacteristic of all of us, she said into my ear(everyone whispered there) - 'Could one ever describethis?' And I answered - 'I can.' It was then thatsomething like a smile slid across what had previouslybeen just a face.[The 1st of April in the year 1957. Leningrad]DEDICATIONMountains fall before this grief,A mighty river stops its flow,But prison doors stay firmly boltedShutting off the convict burrowsAnd an anguish close to death.Fresh winds softly blow for someone,Gentle sunsets warm them through; we don't know this,We are everywhere the same, listeningTo the scrape and turn of hateful keysAnd the heavy tread of marching soldiers.Waking early, as if for early mass,Walking through the capital run wild, gone to seed,We'd meet - the dead, lifeless; the sun, Lower every day; the Neva, mistier:But hope still sings forever in the distance.The verdict. Immediately a flood of tears,Followed by a total isolation,As if a beating heart is painfully ripped out, or,Thumped, she lies there brutally laid out,But she still manages to walk, hesitantly, alone.Where are you, my unwilling friends,Captives of my two satanic years?What miracle do you see in a Siberian blizzard?What shimmering mirage around the circle of the moon?I send each one of you my salutation, and farewell.[March 1940]INTRODUCTION [PRELUDE]It happened like this when only the deadWere smiling, glad of their release,That Leningrad hung around its prisonsLike a worthless emblem, flapping its piece.Shrill and sharp, the steam-whistles sangShort songs of farewellTo the ranks of convicted, demented by suffering,As they, in regiments, walked along -Stars of death stood over usAs innocent Russia squirmedUnder the blood-spattered boots and tyresOf the black marias.IYou were taken away at dawn. I followed you As one does when a corpse is being removed. Children were crying in the darkened house. A candle flared, illuminating the Mother of God. . .The cold of an icon was on your lips, a death-coldsweatOn your brow - I will never forget this; I will gatherTo wail with the wives of the murdered streltsy (1)Inconsolably, beneath the Kremlin towers.[1935. Autumn. Moscow]IISilent flows the river DonA yellow moon looks quietly onSwanking about, with cap askewIt sees through the window a shadow of youGravely ill, all aloneThe moon sees a woman lying at homeHer son is in jail, her husband is dead Say a prayer for her instead.IIIIt isn't me, someone else is suffering. I couldn't.Not like this. Everything that has happened,Cover it with a black cloth, Then let the torches be removed. . .Night.IVGiggling, poking fun, everyone's darling,The carefree sinner of Tsarskoye Selo (2)If only you could have foreseenWhat life would do with you -That you would stand, parcel in hand,Beneath the Crosses (3), three hundredth inline,Burning the new year's iceWith your hot tears.Back and forth the prison poplar swaysWith not a sound - how many innocent Blameless lives are being taken away. . .[1938]VFor seventeen months I have been screaming,Calling you home.I've thrown myself at the feet of butchersFor you, my son and my horror.Everything has become muddled forever -I can no longer distinguishWho is an animal, who a person, and how longThe wait can be for an execution.There are now only dusty flowers,The chinking of the thurible,Tracks from somewhere into nowhereAnd, staring me in the faceAnd threatening me with swift annihilation,An enormous star.[1939]VIWeeks fly lightly by. Even so,I cannot understand what has arisen,How, my son, into your prisonWhite nights stare so brilliantly.Now once more they burn,Eyes that focus like a hawk,And, upon your cross, the talkIs again of death.[1939. Spring]VIITHE VERDICTThe word landed with a stony thudOnto my still-beating breast.Nevermind, I was prepared,I will manage with the rest.I have a lot of work to do today;I need to slaughter memory,Turn my living soul to stoneThen teach myself to live again. . .But how. The hot summer rustlesLike a carnival outside my window;I have long had this premonitionOf a bright day and a deserted house.[22 June 1939. Summer. Fontannyi Dom (4)]VIIITO DEATHYou will come anyway - so why not now?I wait for you; things have become too hard.I have turned out the lights and opened the doorFor you, so simple and so wonderful. Assume whatever shape you wish. Burst in Like a shell of noxious gas. Creep up on me Like a practised bandit with a heavy weapon.Poison me, if you want, with a typhoid exhalation,Or, with a simple tale prepared by you(And known by all to the point of nausea), take me Before the commander of the blue caps and let meglimpse The house administrator's terrified white face.I don't care anymore. The river Yenisey Swirls on. The Pole star blazes.The blue sparks of those much-loved eyesClose over and cover the final horror.[19 August 1939. Fontannyi Dom]IXMadness with its wingsHas covered half my soulIt feeds me fiery wineAnd lures me into the abyss.That's when I understood While listening to my alien deliriumThat I must hand the victoryTo it.However much I nagHowever much I begIt will not let me takeOne single thing away:Not my son's frightening eyes -A suffering set in stone,Or prison visiting hoursOr days that end in stormsNor the sweet coolness of a handThe anxious shade of lime treesNor the light distant soundOf final comforting words.[14 May 1940. Fontannyi Dom]XCRUCIFIXIONWeep not for me, mother.I am alive in my grave.1.A choir of angels glorified the greatest hour,The heavens melted into flames.To his father he said, 'Why hast thou forsaken me!'But to his mother, 'Weep not for me. . .'[1940. Fontannyi Dom]2.Magdalena smote herself and wept,The favourite disciple turned to stone,But there, where the mother stood silent,Not one person dared to look.[1943. Tashkent]EPILOGUE1.I have learned how faces fall,How terror can escape from lowered eyes,How suffering can etch cruel pages Of cuneiform-like marks upon the cheeks.I know how dark or ash-blond strands of hairCan suddenly turn white. I've learned to recogniseThe fading smiles upon submissive lips,The trembling fear inside a hollow laugh.That's why I pray not for myselfBut all of you who stood there with meThrough fiercest cold and scorching July heatUnder a towering, completely blind red wall.2.The hour has come to remember the dead.I see you, I hear you, I feel you:The one who resisted the long drag to the open window;The one who could no longer feel the kick of familiarsoil beneath her feet;The one who, with a sudden flick of her head, replied,'I arrive here as if I've come home!'I'd like to name you all by name, but the listHas been removed and there is nowhere else to look.So,I have woven you this wide shroud out of the humblewordsI overheard you use. Everywhere, forever and always,I will never forget one single thing. Even in newgrief.Even if they clamp shut my tormented mouthThrough which one hundred million people scream;That's how I wish them to remember me when I am deadOn the eve of my remembrance day.If someone someday in this country Decides to raise a memorial to me,I give my consent to this festivityBut only on this condition - do not build itBy the sea where I was born,I have severed my last ties with the sea;Nor in the Tsar's Park by the hallowed stumpWhere an inconsolable shadow looks for me;Build it here where I stood for three hundred hoursAnd no-one slid open the bolt.Listen, even in blissful death I fearThat I will forget the Black Marias,Forget how hatefully the door slammed and an old womanHowled like a wounded beast.Let the thawing ice flow like tearsFrom my immovable bronze eyelidsAnd let the prison dove coo in the distanceWhile ships sail quietly along the river.[March 1940.

                        I fled Him down the nights and down the daysI fled Him down the arches of the yearsI fled Him down the labyrinthine waysOf my own mind, and in the midst of tearsI hid from him, and under running laughter.Up vistaed hopes I sped and shot precipitatedAdown titanic glooms of chasme d hearsFrom those strong feet that followed, followed afterBut with unhurrying chase and unperturbe d pace,Deliberate speed, majestic instancy,They beat, and a Voice beat,More instant than the feet:All things betray thee who betrayest me.I pleaded, outlaw--wise by many a hearted casement,curtained red, trellised with inter-twining charities,For though I knew His love who followe d,Yet was I sore adread, lest having Him,I should have nought beside.But if one little casement parted wide,The gust of his approach would clash it to.Fear wist not to evade as Love wist to pursue.Across the margent of the world I fled,And troubled the gold gateways of the stars,Smiting for shelter on their clange d bars,Fretted to dulcet jars and silvern chatterThe pale ports of the moon.I said to Dawn --- be sudden, to Eve --- be soon,With thy young skiey blossoms heap me overFrom this tremendous Lover.Float thy vague veil about me lest He see.I tempted all His servitors but to findMy own betrayal in their constancy,In faith to Him, their fickleness to me,Their traitorous trueness and their loyal deceit.To all swift things for swiftness did I sue,Clung to the whistling mane of every wind,But whether they swept, smoothly fleet,The long savannahs of the blue,Or whether, thunder-driven,They clanged His chariot thwart a heaven,Plashy with flying lightnings round the spurn of their feet,Fear wist not to evade as Love wist to pursue.Still with unhurrying chase and unperturbed paceDeliberate speed, majestic instancy,Came on the following feet, and a Voice above their beat:Nought shelters thee who wilt not shelter Me.I sought no more that after which I strayedIn face of Man or Maid.But still within the little childrens' eyesSeems something, something that replies,They at least are for me, surely for me.But just as their young eyes grew sudden fair,With dawning answers there,Their angel plucked them from me by the hair.Come then, ye other children, Nature'sShare with me, said I, your delicate fellowship.Let me greet you lip to lip,Let me twine with you caresses,Wantoning with our Lady Mother's vagrant tresses,Banqueting with her in her wind walled palace,Underneath her azured dai:s,Quaffing, as your taintless way is,From a chalice, lucent weeping out of the dayspring.So it was done.I in their delicate fellowship was one.Drew the bolt of Nature's secrecies,I knew all the swift importings on the wilful face of skies,I knew how the clouds arise,Spume d of the wild sea-snortings.All that's born or dies,Rose and drooped with,Made them shapers of mine own moods, or wailful, or Divine.With them joyed and was bereaven.I was heavy with the Even,when she lit her glimmering tapers round the day's dead sanctities.I laughed in the morning's eyes.I triumphed and I saddened with all weather,Heaven and I wept together,and its sweet tears were salt with mortal mine.Against the red throb of its sunset heart,I laid my own to beatAnd share commingling heat.But not by that, by that was eased my human smart.In vain my tears were wet on Heaven's grey cheek.For ah! we know what each other says,these things and I; In sound I speak,Their sound is but their stir, they speak by silences.Nature, poor step-dame, cannot slake my drouth.Let her, if she would owe meDrop yon blue-bosomed veil of skyAnd show me the breasts o' her tenderness.Never did any milk of hers once bless my thirsting mouth.Nigh and nigh draws the chase, with unperturbe d paceDeliberate speed, majestic instancy,And past those noise d feet, a Voice comes yet more fleet:Lo, nought contentst thee who content'st nought Me.Naked, I wait thy Love's uplifted stroke. My harness, piece by piece,thou'st hewn from meAnd smitten me to my knee,I am defenceless, utterly.I slept methinks, and awoke.And slowly gazing, find me stripped in sleep.In the rash lustihead of my young powers,I shook the pillaring hours,and pulled my life upon me.Grimed with smears,I stand amidst the dust o' the mounded years--My mangled youth lies dead beneath the heap.My days have crackled and gone up in smoke,Have puffed and burst like sunstarts on a stream.Yeah, faileth now even dream the dreamerand the lute, the lutanist.Even the linked fantasies in whose blossomy twist,I swung the Earth, a trinket at my wrist,Have yielded, cords of all too weak account,For Earth, with heavy grief so overplussed.Ah! is thy Love indeed a weed,albeit an Amaranthine weed,Suffering no flowers except its own to mount?Ah! must, Designer Infinite,Ah! must thou char the wood 'ere thou canst limn with it ?My freshness spent its wavering shower i' the dust.And now my heart is as a broken fount,Wherein tear-drippings stagnate, spilt down everFrom the dank thoughts that shiver upon the sighful branches of mymind.Such is. What is to be ?The pulp so bitter, how shall taste the rind ?I dimly guess what Time in mists confounds,Yet ever and anon, a trumpet soundsFrom the hid battlements of Eternity.Those shaken mists a space unsettle,Then round the half-glimpse d turrets, slowly wash again.But not 'ere Him who summonethI first have seen, enwoundWith glooming robes purpureal; Cypress crowned.His name I know, and what his trumpet saith.Whether Man's Heart or Life it be that yield thee harvest,Must thy harvest fields be dunged with rotten death ?Now of that long pursuit,Comes at hand the bruit.That Voice is round me like a bursting Sea:And is thy Earth so marred,Shattered in shard on shard?Lo, all things fly thee, for thou fliest me.Strange, piteous, futile thing;Wherefore should any set thee love apart?Seeing none but I makes much of Naught (He said).And human love needs human meriting ---How hast thou merited,Of all Man's clotted clay, the dingiest clot.Alack! Thou knowest notHow little worthy of any love thou art.Whom wilt thou find to love ignoble thee,Save me, save only me?All which I took from thee, I did'st but take,Not for thy harms,But just that thou might'st seek it in my arms.All which thy childs mistake fancies as lost,I have stored for thee at Home.Rise, clasp my hand, and come.Halts by me that Footfall.Is my gloom, after all,Shade of His hand, outstretched caressingly?Ah, Fondest, Blindest, Weakest,I am He whom thou seekest.Thou dravest Love from thee who dravest Me. 
                        

                        I have desired to goWhere springs not fail,To fields where flies no sharp and sided hail,And a few lilies blow.And I have asked to beWhere no storms come,Where the green swell is in the havens dumb,And out of the swing of the sea. 
                        

                        Never trust a white man,Never kill a Jew,Never sign a contract,Never rent a pew.Don't enlist in armies;Nor marry many wives;Never write for magazines;Never scratch your hives.Always put paper on the seat,Don't believe in wars,Keep yourself both clean and neat,Never marry whores.Never pay a blackmailer,Never go to law,Never trust a publisher,Or you'll sleep on straw.All your friends will leave youAll your friends will dieSo lead a clean and wholesome lifeAnd join them in the sky. 
                        

                        There! little girl; don't cry! They have broken your doll, I know; And your tea-set blue, And your play-house, too, Are things of the long ago; But childish troubles will soon pass by. -- There! little girl; don't cry! There! little girl; don't cry! They have broken your slate, I know; And the glad, wild ways Of your schoolgirl days Are things of the long ago; But life and love will soon come by. -- There! little girl; don't cry! There! little girl; don't cry! They have broken your heart I know; And the rainbow gleams Of your youthful dreams Are things of the long ago; But Heaven holds all for which you sigh. -- There! little girl; don't cry! 
                        

                        I'll tell you something: every daypeople are dying. And that's just the beginning.Every day, in funeral homes, new widows are born,new orphans. They sit with their hands folded,trying to decide about this new life.Then they're in the cemetery, some of themfor the first time. They're frightened of crying,sometimes of not crying. Someone leans over,tells them what to do next, which might meansaying a few words, sometimesthrowing dirt in the open grave.And after that, everyone goes back to the house,which is suddenly full of visitors.The widow sits on the couch, very stately,so people line up to approach her,sometimes take her hand, sometimes embrace her.She finds something to say to everbody,thanks them, thanks them for coming.In her heart, she wants them to go away.She wants to be back in the cemetery,back in the sickroom, the hospital. She knowsit isn't possible. But it's her only hope,the wish to move backward. And just a little,not so far as the marriage, the first kiss. 
                        

                        When the frost is on the punkin and the fodder's in the shockAnd you hear the kyouck and gobble of the struttin' turkey cockAnd the clackin' of the guineys, and the cluckin' of the hensAnd the rooster's hallylooyer as he tiptoes on the fenceO, it's then's the times a feller is a-feelin' at his bestWith the risin' sun to greet him from a night of peaceful restAs he leaves the house, bareheaded, and goes out to feed the stockWhen the frost is on the punkin and the fodder's in the shock They's something kindo' harty-like about the atmusfere When the heat of summer's over and the coolin' fall is here Of course we miss the flowers, and the blossums on the treesAnd the mumble of the hummin'-birds and buzzin' of the beesBut the air's so appetizin'; and the landscape through the haze Of a crisp and sunny morning of the airly autumn days Is a pictur' that no painter has the colorin' to mock When the frost is on the punkin and the fodder's in the shock. The husky, rusty russel of the tossels of the corn, And the raspin' of the tangled leaves, as golden as the morn; The stubble in the furries kindo' lonesome-like, but still A-preachin' sermuns to us of the barns they growed to fill; The strawstack in the medder, and the reaper in the shed; The hosses in theyr stalls below the clover over-head! O, it sets my hart a-clickin' like the tickin' of a clock, When the frost is on the punkin and the fodder's in the shock! Then your apples all is gethered, and the ones a feller keeps Is poured around the celler-floor in red and yeller heaps; And your cider-makin' 's over, and your wimmern-folks is through With their mince and apple butter, and theyr souse and saussage, too!I don't know how to tell it but ef sich a thing could be As the Angels wantin' boardin', and they'd call around on me I'd want to 'commodate 'em all the whole-indurin' flockWhen the frost is on the punkin and the fodder's in the shock! 
                        

                        IMy fairest child, I have no song to give you; No lark could pipe to skies so dull and grey: Yet, ere we part, one lesson I can leave you For every day. II Be good, sweet maid, and let who will be clever; Do noble things, not dream them, all day long: And so make life, death, and that vast for-ever One grand, sweet song. 
                        

                        Does it matter? -losing your legs? For people will always be kind,And you need not show that you mindWhen others come in after huntingTo gobble their muffins and eggs.Does it matter? -losing you sight? There’s such splendid work for the blind; And people will always be kind,As you sit on the terrace rememberingAnd turning your face to the light.Do they matter-those dreams in the pit? You can drink and forget and be glad,And people won't say that you’re mad; For they know that you've fought for your country,And no one will worry a bit. 
                        

                        When I asked sea about the Pearls, It laughed and said that is one of my lovely jewels.When I asked about light to the sun! Overjoyed, he uttered there is no life without it.I asked river, What pleases its heart? And she said, to become lovely waterfall.I asked flowers; tell me why thy blossom is for? To play with the wind, the scent waft, Byron persecutes, and for it I live.I asked moon, tell me your purpose of life? To come at night play with stars and allure with waves and play hide and seek.When I asked Mount, What is the purpose of your standing tall? He said, to talk with clouds and convince them to fall on earth.I asked, Birds tell me your whereabouts? And they said, To fly high, to talk with winds and to sing a song.And all of them asked me; Now you tell us what your heart feels about? I said the greatest jewel of my life is bigger than all yours and that is for my Beloved Sister.Because, Her love is deeper than the sea, her faith is more firm than mountains.Her feelings are more gentle than the flowers, Lighter than clouds, playful like riversAnd she is bigger than the sky of Sun, Moon and all stars And of course she is my Sister, My loving Sister - Farah Naaz. 
                        

                        Oh Companion That Abode Is Unmatched, Where My Complete Beloved Is. In that Place There Is No Happiness or Unhappiness, No Truth or Untruth Neither Sin Nor Virtue. There Is No Day or Night, No Moon or Sun, There Is Radiance Without Light. There Is No Knowledge or Meditation No Repetition of Mantra or Austerities, Neither Speech Coming From Vedas or Books. Doing, Not-Doing, Holding, Leaving All These Are All Lost Too In This Place. No Home, No Homeless, Neither Outside or Inside, Micro and Macrocosm Are Non-Existent. Five Elemental Constituents and the Trinity Are Both Not There Witnessing Un-struck Shabad Sound is Also Not There. No Root or Flower, Neither Branch or Seed, Without a Tree Fruits are Adorning, Primordial Om Sound, Breath-Synchronized Soham, This and That - All Are Absent, The Breath Too Unknown Where the Beloved Is There is Utterly Nothing Says Kabir I Have Come To Realize.

                        Yes, I remember Adlestrop -- The name, because one afternoon Of heat the express-train drew up there Unwontedly. It was late June. The steam hissed. Someone cleared his throat. No one left and no one came On the bare platform. What I saw Was Adlestrop -- only the name And willows, willow-herb, and grass, And meadowsweet, and haycocks dry, No whit less still and lonely fair Than the high cloudlets in the sky. And for that minute a blackbird sang Close by, and round him, mistier, Farther and farther, all the birds Of Oxfordshire and Gloucestershire. 
                        

                        What's friendship? The hangover's faction,The gratis talk of outrage,Exchange by vanity, inaction,Or bitter shame of patronage. 
                        

                        The morning rays of the Sun clingOn the upper bow of the RainbowEmerge after a moment ‘s duskBrown Pelicans and Western GullsFly beneath the lower bowThat touches the waterSend fishes into hidingAs I walk along the white beachLooking at the sea, the blue watersDance its way towards the golden sandShy away from the smiling horizonOnce, in a jubilant second, vessels across, Scream their hearts out, Ignite the nature’s garlandThe Princess of the Sea, Colorful as Galaxies dustCatches watchful eyes off-guardThe seven colors spectrum is the sensesNourishes the need and desireLike a prism, it passes through every heartLeaving the lights of absolutionWindward and crystallizeRed, orange, yellowLife and love bestowsGreen, blue, indigoShips of love embargoEngaged for passionVioletRhymes like coupletOne kiss, Over the rainbowBreaches the distanceBetween friendshipAnd love 
                        

                        You could have been more polite observing me, Your harsh words have left An indelible impression, Hatred can be won by love alone, As one gets relief from Scorching heat By gentle rain, As the sermon of a saint soothes The disturbed mind, Your words could have healed The wounds of my heart, For once you touched me, felt me, And covered your being with my love, As you said, You smelt my love and called it red rose, What's happened now? Thorns have grown on my lips, My being has become the grave of your hatred, Is it a diversion Or you're posing to be more sensible? 
                        

                        Where the mountains touch the sky, Where poets DREAM, where eagles fly, A secret place above the crowd, Just beneath a silver-lined cloud. Lift your eyes to a snowy peak, And see the soon-to-be we seek. Whisper DREAMS and let them rise, To the mountains old and wise. Climbers climb, it's time to try, Where the mountains touch the sky. Take me there. Oh take me now, Someway, Someday, Somewhere, Somehow. Where the ocean meets the sky, Where mermaid dance, where seagulls fly, A place in DREAMS I know so well, The sea inside a single shell. Far across the living sea, A pale blue possibility, Beyond the castles made of sand, Tomorrow in a small child's hand. Only DREAMERS need apply, Where the ocean meets the sky. Take me there. Oh take me now, Someway, Someday, Somewhere, Somehow. A common ground for one and all, Behind the crystal waterfall, Where Peace flows like a mighty stream, Like Dr. King I have a DREAM. Imagine such a goal in sight, For red and yellow, black and white… New Delhi, Beijing, Kenya, Rome, Earth is the place that we call home. Baghdad, Belfast, Tel Aviv, One race HUMAN, we still believe, Come DREAM with me... Where the forests reach the sky, Wake to DREAMS, and don’t be shy. We’ll DREAM the world a thorn-less rose; We’ll plant then watch it as it grows. We’ll conquer hate with DREAMS of hope, We’ll DREAM one big kaleidoscope. Whisper now; let the DREAM begin, It's time to trust the truth within. This is where we seek and find… A place called PEACE for humankind. DREAM on DREAMERS, hopes are high, Where the forests reach the sky. Take me there. Oh take me now, Someway, Someday, Somewhere, Somehow. Now, listen close, the future calls... 'Build your bridges and tear down walls! ' For time has taught and so it seems, Realities are born of DREAMS! Whisper DREAMS and let them rise, To the mountains old and wise. 
                        

                        Believe me, if all those endearing young charms,Which I gaze on so fondly to-day,Were to change by to-morrow, and fleet in my arms,Live fairy-gifts fading away,Thou wouldst still be adored, as this moment thou art,Let thy loveliness fade as it will,And around the dear ruin each wish of my heartWould entwine itself verdantly still.It is not while beauty and youth are thine own,And thy cheeks unprofaned by a tear,That the fervor and faith of a soul may be known,To which time will but make thee more dear!No, the heart that has truly loved never forgets,But as truly loves on to the close,As the sunflower turns on her god when he setsThe same look which she turned when he rose! 
                        

                        All dreams may not come true All credits due may not accrue But with true reflection in mind  Ideas newer and newer may emerge and find though may not be the nature too so kind  Dreaming in day time is not at all goodGood thoughts and efforts work as foodEarnest efforts to come out of woodFailure may stun and you loose the hopeStill not difficult to walk on tight ropeIt is not bad to dream for high skySpeak always truth and do not lieYou may not have wings to flyStill nothing wrong to work and try No need to think or needlessly cryYou must have third sense to riseAll acts should be sensible and wiseRise and fall is part of the game Goal and ideas you must frameNo use trying luck or fate to blame What ever you do must be with resolve? Take full blame and never try to absolvePut in best efforts to come out and solveFull dedication and make everybody to involveTry to mix with all as soluble dissolve  Despite put in best efforts it may not materializeFailure may be sure but we may not visualizeAll draw backs reasons before us but can't analyzeComplete system may run into trouble and paralyzeStill strive very hard to see the reason and synchronizeComplete days routine and reflections of day's thoughtsIn night, thoughts clash and hard won battles are fought Freedom and joy sincerely thought and broughtStealing in day time but not easily caughtSimply night dreaming when lying in the cot Continue to seek solution in dream, Energy not focused but travel in beamTry very hard and work as team, Good efforts in direction but not as power gameNot letting any opportunity with excuses lame So I find easy way to seek refuge in night Lie low and have good say without light more and more attention I try to pay Always hope to find way in form of ray washing shores with water at feet of bay.Life doesn't end with setting of daySun may rise again with bright rayYour hopes may be high and tallVast horizon may lie open for allTry for success without any fallCome what may be the sloganLife and opportunities may begunNothing to loose with worth attemptSometimes you may gain with action prompt 
                        

                        Even the impossible can be donebecause I believe it canthe toughest challenge can be wonbecause I am a fighting man...there's a fire burning in my eyes, because I'm after the prize.Anything far-fetched can be achievedyes, it can be donebecause in truth I believethat I am the right onebut that's no surprise, cause' there's a fire burning in my eyes.Anything unlikely can be overcomein an hour of darknesseven though there exists somewho think the situation is hopelessbut my spirit never dies, because there's a fire burning in my eyes.My heart is ablazewith the flame of triumphmy soul alightwith this fire of successan eternal inferno rages within meand when you peer into my eyesthen you will seethe fire burning within....The fire burning within my eyes.

                        1Complacencies of the peignoir, and lateCoffee and oranges in a sunny chair,And the green freedom of a cockatooUpon a rug mingle to dissipateThe holy hush of ancient sacrifice.She dreams a little, and she feels the darkEncroachment of that old catastrophe,As a calm darkens among water-lights.The pungent oranges and bright, green wingsSeem things in some procession of the dead,Winding across wide water, without sound.The day is like wide water, without sound,Stilled for the passing of her dreaming feetOver the seas, to silent Palestine,Dominion of the blood and sepulchre.2Why should she give her bounty to the dead?What is divinity if it can comeOnly in silent shadows and in dreams?Shall she not find in comforts of the sun,In pungent fruit and bright green wings, or elseIn any balm or beauty of the earth,Things to be cherished like the thought of heaven?Divinity must live within herself:Passions of rain, or moods in falling snow;Grievings in loneliness, or unsubduedElations when the forest blooms; gustyEmotions on wet roads on autumn nights;All pleasures and all pains, rememberingThe bough of summer and the winter branch.These are the measure destined for her soul.3Jove in the clouds had his inhuman birth.No mother suckled him, no sweet land gaveLarge-mannered motions to his mythy mind.He moved among us, as a muttering king,Magnificent, would move among his hinds,Until our blood, commingling, virginal,With heaven, brought such requital to desireThe very hinds discerned it, in a star.Shall our blood fail? Or shall it come to beThe blood of paradise? And shall the earthSeem all of paradise that we shall know?The sky will be much friendlier then than now,A part of labor and a part of pain,And next in glory to enduring love,Not this dividing and indifferent blue.4She says, 'I am content when wakened birds,Before they fly, test the reality Of misty fields, by their sweet questionings;But when the birds are gone, and their warm fieldsReturn no more, where, then, is paradise?'There is not any haunt of prophecy,Nor any old chimera of the grave,Neither the golden underground, nor isleMelodious, where spirits gat them home,Nor visionary south, nor cloudy palmRemote on heaven's hill, that has enduredAs April's green endures; or will endureLike her remembrance of awakened birds,Or her desire for June and evening, tippedBy the consummation of the swallow's wings.5She says, 'But in contentment I still feelThe need of some imperishable bliss.'Death is the mother of beauty; hence from her,Alone, shall come fulfillment to our dreamsAnd our desires. Although she strews the leavesOf sure obliteration on our paths,The path sick sorrow took, the many pathsWhere triumph rang its brassy phrase, or loveWhispered a little out of tenderness,She makes the willow shiver in the sunFor maidens who were wont to sit and gazeUpon the grass, relinquished to their feet.She causes boys to pile new plums and pearsOn disregarded plate. The maidens tasteAnd stray impassioned in the littering leaves.6Is there no change of death in paradise?Does ripe fruit never fall? Or do the boughsHang always heavy in that perfect sky,Unchanging, yet so like our perishing earth,With rivers like our own that seek for seasThey never find, the same receding shoresThat never touch with inarticulate pang?Why set pear upon those river-banksOr spice the shores with odors of the plum?Alas, that they should wear our colors there,The silken weavings of our afternoons,And pick the strings of our insipid lutes!Death is the mother of beauty, mystical,Within whose burning bosom we deviseOur earthly mothers waiting, sleeplessly.7Supple and turbulent, a ring of menShall chant in orgy on a summer mornTheir boisterous devotion to the sun,Not as a god, but as a god might be,Naked among them, like a savage source.Their chant shall be a chant of paradise,Out of their blood, returning to the sky;And in their chant shall enter, voice by voice,The windy lake wherein their lord delights,The trees, like serafin, and echoing hills,That choir among themselves long afterward.They shall know well the heavenly fellowshipOf men that perish and of summer morn.And whence they came and whither they shall goThe dew upon their feet shall manifest.8She hears, upon that water without sound,A voice that cries, 'The tomb in PalestineIs not the porch of spirits lingering.It is the grave of Jesus, where he lay.'We live in an old chaos of the sun,Or old dependency of day and night,Or island solitude, unsponsored, free,Of that wide water, inescapable.Deer walk upon our mountains, and the quailWhistle about us their spontaneous cries;Sweet berries ripen in the wilderness;And, in the isolation of the sky,At evening, casual flocks of pigeons makeAmbiguous undulations as they sink,Downward to darkness, on extended wings. 
                        

                        Always be drunk.That's it!The great imperative!In order not to feelTime's horrid fardelbruise your shoulders,grinding you into the earth,Get drunk and stay that way.On what?On wine, poetry, virtue, whatever.But get drunk.And if you sometimes happen to wake upon the porches of a palace,in the green grass of a ditch,in the dismal loneliness of your own room,your drunkenness gone or disappearing,ask the wind,the wave,the star,the bird,the clock,ask everything that flees,everything that groansor rollsor sings,everything that speaks,ask what time it is;and the wind,the wave,the star,the bird,the clockwill answer you:"Time to get drunk!Don't be martyred slaves of Time,Get drunk!Stay drunk!On wine, virtue, poetry, whatever!" 
                        

                        Awed by her splendor stars near the lovely moon cover their own bright faces 	when she is roundest and lights earth with her silver 
                        

                        Three weeks gone and the combatants gonereturning over the nightmare groundwe found the place again, and foundthe soldier sprawling in the sun.The frowning barrel of his gunovershadowing. As we came onthat day, he hit my tank with onelike the entry of a demon.Look. Here in the gunpit spoilthe dishonoured picture of his girlwho has put: Steffi. Vergissmeinnicht.in a copybook gothic script.We see him almost with content,abased, and seeming to have paidand mocked at by his own equipmentthat's hard and good when he's decayed.But she would weep to see todayhow on his skin the swart flies move;the dust upon the paper eyeand the burst stomach like a cave.For here the lover and killer are mingledwho had one body and one heart.And death who had the soldier singledhas done the lover mortal hurt. 
                        

                        Come, walk with me, There's only thee To bless my spirit now - We used to love on winter nightsTo wander through the snow; Can we not woo back old delights?The clouds rush dark and wild They fleck with shade our mountain heightsThe same as long ago And on the horizon rest at lastIn looming masses piled; While moonbeams flash and fly so fastWe scarce can say they smiled - Come walk with me, come walk with me;We were not once so fewBut Death has stolen our companyAs sunshine steals the dew -He took them one by one and we Are left the only two; So closer would my feelings twineBecause they have no stay but thine - 'Nay call me not - it may not beIs human love so true? Can Friendship's flower droop on for yearsAnd then revive anew? No, though the soil be wet with tears, How fair soe'er it grewThe vital sap once perishedWill never flow again And surer than that dwelling dread,The narrow dungeon of the dead Time parts the hearts of men -' 
                        

                        She sits in the park. Her clothes are out of date.Two children whine and bicker, tug her skirt.A third draws aimless patterns in the dirtSomeone she loved once passed by – too lateto feign indifference to that casual nod.“How nice” et cetera. “Time holds great surprises.”From his neat head unquestionably risesa small balloon…”but for the grace of God…”They stand a while in flickering light, rehearsingthe children’s names and birthdays. “It’s so sweetto hear their chatter, watch them grow and thrive, ”she says to his departing smile. Then, nursingthe youngest child, sits staring at her feet.To the wind she says, “They have eaten me alive.” 
                        

                        I am the only being whose doomNo tongue would ask no eye would mournI never caused a thought of gloomA smile of joy since I was born In secret pleasure - secret tearsThis changeful life has slipped awayAs friendless after eighteen yearsAs lone as on my natal day There have been times I cannot hideThere have been times when this was drearWhen my sad soul forgot its prideAnd longed for one to love me here But those were in the early glowOf feelings since subdued by careAnd they have died so long agoI hardly now believe they were First melted off the hope of youthThen Fancy's rainbow fast withdrewAnd then experience told me truthIn mortal bosoms never grew 'Twas grief enough to think mankindAll hollow servile insincere -But worse to trust to my own mindAnd find the same corruption there 
                        

                        My old flame, my wife!Remember our lists of birds?One morning last summer, I droveby our house in Maine. It was stillon top of its hill -Now a red ear of Indian maizewas splashed on the door.Old Glory with thirteen stripes hung on a pole. The clapboardwas old-red schoolhouse red.Inside, a new landlord,a new wife, a new broom!Atlantic seaboard antique shoppewter and plundershone in each room.A new frontier!No running next doornow to phone the sherifffor his taxi to Bathand the State Liquor Store!No one saw your ghostly imaginary loverstare through the windowand tightenthe scarf at his throat.Health to the new people,health to their flag, to their oldrestored house on the hill!Everything had been swept bare,furnished, garnished and aired.Everything's changed for the best -how quivering and fierce we were,there snowbound together,simmering like waspsin our tent of books!Poor ghost, old love, speakwith your old voiceof flaming insightthat kept us awake all night.In one bed and apart,we heard the plowgroaning up hill -a red light, then a blue,as it tossed off the snowto the side of the road. 
                        

                        No stir in the air, no stir in the sea, The Ship was still as she could be; Her sails from heaven received no motion, Her keel was steady in the ocean. Without either sign or sound of their shock, The waves flow’d over the Inchcape Rock; So little they rose, so little they fell, They did not move the Inchcape Bell.The Abbot of Aberbrothok Had placed that bell on the Inchcape Rock; On a buoy in the storm it floated and swung, And over the waves its warning rung.When the Rock was hid by the surge’s swell, The Mariners heard the warning Bell; And then they knew the perilous Rock, And blest the Abbot of AberbrothokThe Sun in the heaven was shining gay, All things were joyful on that day; The sea-birds scream’d as they wheel’d round, And there was joyaunce in their sound. The buoy of the Inchcpe Bell was seenA darker speck on the ocean green; Sir Ralph the Rover walk’d his deck, And fix’d his eye on the darker speck. He felt the cheering power of spring, It made him whistle, it made him sing; His heart was mirthful to excess, But the Rover’s mirth was wickedness. His eye was on the Inchcape Float; Quoth he, “My men, put out the boat, And row me to the Inchcape Rock, And I’ll plague the Abbot of Aberbrothok.” The boat is lower’d, the boatmen row, And to the Inchcape Rock they go; Sir Ralph bent over from the boat, And he cut the bell from the Inchcape Float.Down sank the Bell with a gurgling sound, The bubbles rose and burst around; Quoth Sir Ralph, “The next who comes to the Rock,Won’t bless the Abbot of Aberbrothok.” Sir ralph the Rover sail’d away, He scour’d the seas for many a day; And now grown rich with plunder’d store, He steers his course for Scotland’s shore. So thick a haze o’erspreads the sky, They cannot see the sun on high; The wind hath blown a gale all day, At evening it hath died away. On the deck the Rover takes his stand, So dark it is they see no land. Quoth Sir Ralph, “It will be lighter soon, For there is the dawn of the rising Moon.” “Canst hear,” said one, “the breakers roar? For methinks we should be near the shore.” “Now, where we are I cannot tell, But I wish we could hear the Inchcape Bell.” They hear no sound, the swell is strong, Though the wind hath fallen they drift along; Till the vessel strikes with a shivering shock, “Oh Christ! It is the Inchcape Rock!” Sir Ralph the Rover tore his hair, He curst himself in his despair; The waves rush in on every side, The ship is sinking beneath the tide. But even is his dying fear, One dreadful sound could the Rover hear; A sound as if with the Inchcape Bell, The Devil below was ringing his knell. 
                        

                        The tasteof rain—Why kneel? 
                        

                        when I watch you wrapped up like garbage sitting, surrounded by the smell of too old potato peels orwhen I watch you in your old man's shoes with the little toe cut out sitting, waiting for your mind like next week's grocery I saywhen I watch youyou wet brown bag of a woman who used to be the best looking gal in Georgiaused to be called the Georgia RoseI stand upthrough your destructionI stand up 
                        

                        I knew a woman, lovely in her bones, When small birds sighed, she would sigh back at them; Ah, when she moved, she moved more ways than one: The shapes a bright container can contain! Of her choice virtues only gods should speak, Or English poets who grew up on Greek (I'd have them sing in a chorus, cheek to cheek). How well her wishes went! She stroked my chin, She taught me Turn, and Counter-turn, and Stand; She taught me Touch, that undulant white skin; I nibbled meekly from her proferred hand; She was the sickle; I, poor I, the rake, Coming behind her for her pretty sake (But what prodigious mowing we did make). Love likes a gander, and adores a goose: Her full lips pursed, the errant notes to sieze; She played it quick, she played it light and loose; My eyes, they dazzled at her flowing knees; Her several parts could keep a pure repose, Or one hip quiver with a mobile nose (She moved in circles, and those circles moved). Let seed be grass, and grass turn into hay: I'm martyr to a motion not my own; What's freedom for? To know eternity. I swear she cast a shadow white as stone. But who would count eternity in days? These old bones live to learn her wanton ways: (I measure time by how a body sways).

                        Daughters of Time, the hypocritic Days,Muffled and dumb like barefoot dervishes,And marching single in an endless file,Bring diadems and fagots in their hands.To each they offer gifts after his will,Bread, kingdom, stars, and sky that holds them all.I, in my pleached garden, watched the pomp,Forgot my morning wishes, hastilyTook a few herbs and apples, and the DayTurned and departed silent. I, too late,Under her solemn fillet saw the scorn.

                        My love is like to ice, and I to fire:How comes it then that this her cold so greatIs not dissolved through my so hot desire,But harder grows the more I her entreat?Or how comes it that my exceeding heatIs not allayed by her heart-frozen cold,But that I burn much more in boiling sweat,And feel my flames augmented manifold?What more miraculous thing may be told,That fire, which all things melts, should harden ice,And ice, which is congeal'd with senseless cold,Should kindle fire by wonderful device?Such is the power of love in gentle mind,That it can alter all the course of kind. 
                        

                        To you who'd read my songs of War And only hear of blood and fame, I'll say (you've heard it said before)  "War's Hell! " and if you doubt the same, Today I found in Mametz WoodA certain cure for lust of blood: Where, propped against a shattered trunk, In a great mess of things unclean, Sat a dead Boche; he scowled and stunk With clothes and face a sodden green,Big-bellied, spectacled, crop-haired, Dribbling black blood from nose and beard. 
                        

                        My son aged three fell in the nettle bed.'Bed' seemed a curious name for those green spears,That regiment of spite behind the shed:It was no place for rest.  With sobs and tearsThe boy came seeking comfort and I sawWhite blisters beaded on his tender skin.We soothed him till his pain was not so raw.At last he offered us a watery grin,And then I took my billhook, honed the bladeAnd went outside and slashed in fury with itTill not a nettle in that fierce paradeStood upright any more.  And then I litA funeral pyre to burn the fallen dead,But in two weeks the busy sun and rainHad called up tall recruits behind the shed:My son would often feel sharp wounds again.Submitted by Andrew Mayers 
                        

                        IF all the world and love were young, And truth in every shepherd's tongue, These pretty pleasures might me move To live with thee and be thy Love. But Time drives flocks from field to fold; When rivers rage and rocks grow cold; And Philomel becometh dumb; The rest complains of cares to come. The flowers do fade, and wanton fields To wayward Winter reckoning yields: A honey tongue, a heart of gall, Is fancy's spring, but sorrow's fall. Thy gowns, thy shoes, thy beds of roses, Thy cap, thy kirtle, and thy posies, Soon break, soon wither--soon forgotten, In folly ripe, in reason rotten. Thy belt of straw and ivy-buds, Thy coral clasps and amber studs,-- All these in me no means can move To come to thee and be thy Love. But could youth last, and love still breed, Had joys no date, nor age no need, Then these delights my mind might move To live with thee and be thy Love. 
                        

                        Look to this day:For it is life, the very life of life.In its brief courseLie all the verities and realities of your existence.The bliss of growth,The glory of action,The splendour of achievementAre but experiences of time. For yesterday is but a dreamAnd tomorrow is only a vision;And today well-lived, makesYesterday a dream of happinessAnd every tomorrow a vision of hope.Look well therefore to this day;Such is the salutation to the ever-new dawn! 
                        

                        O fleece, that down the neck waves to the nape!O curls! O perfume nonchalant and rare!O ecstasy! To fill this alcove shapeWith memories that in these tresses sleep,I would shake them like penions in the air!Languorous Asia, burning Africa,And a far world, defunct almost, absent,Within your aromatic forest stay!As other souls on music drift away,Mine, O my love! still floats upon your scent.I shall go there where, full of sap, both treeAnd man swoon in the heat of the southern climates;Strong tresses be the swell that carries me!I dream upon your sea of amberOf dazzling sails, of oarsmen, masts, and flames:A sun-drenched and reverberating port,Where I imbibe colour and sound and scent;Where vessels, gliding through the gold and moiré,Open their vast arms as they leave the shoreTo clasp the pure and shimmering firmament.I'll plunge my head, enamored of its pleasure,In this black ocean where the other hides;My subtle spirit then will know a measureOf fertile idleness and fragrant leisure,Lulled by the infinite rhythm of its tides!Pavilion, of autumn-shadowed tresses spun,You give me back the azure from afar;And where the twisted locks are fringed with downLurk mingled odors I grow drunk uponOf oil of coconut, of musk, and tar.A long time! always! my hand in your hairWill sow the stars of sapphire, pearl, ruby,That you be never deaf to my desire,My oasis and my gourd whence I aspireTo drink deep of the wine of memory. 
                        

                        The bonsai treein the attractive potcould have grown eighty feet tallon the side of a mountaintill split by lightning.But a gardenercarefully pruned it.It is nine inches high.Every day as hewhittles back the branchesthe gardener croons,It is your natureto be small and cozy,domestic and weak;how lucky, little tree,to have a pot to grow in.With living creaturesone must begin very earlyto dwarf their growth:the bound feet,the crippled brain,the hair in curlers,the hands youlove to touch. 
                        

                        When we two parted  In silence and tears, Half broken-hearted  To sever for years, Pale grew thy cheek and cold,  Colder thy kiss; Truly that hour foretold  Sorrow to this. The dew of the morning  Sunk chill on my brow-  It felt like the warning  Of what I feel now. Thy vows are all broken,  And light is thy fame; I hear thy name spoken,  And share in its shame. They name thee before me,  A knell to mine ear; A shrudder comes o'er me-   Why wert thou so dear? They know not I knew thee,  Who knew thee so well-  Long, long I shall rue thee,  Too deeply to tell. In secret we met-   In silence I grieve, That thy heart could forget,  Thy spirit deceive If I should meet thee  After long years, How should I greet thee? -   With silence and tears.

Harum rerum notitiam semper ambivit ingenium humanum, nunquamattigit.

Burnet, Archaeol.Phil., p. 68 (slightly edited by Coleridge).Translation                            -------------------ARGUMENTHow a Ship having passed the Line was driven by storms to the cold Countrytowards the South Pole ; and how from thence she made her course to thetropical Latitude of the Great Pacific Ocean ; and of the strange thingsthat befell ; and in what manner the Ancyent Marinere came back to his ownCountry.PART IAn ancient Mariner meeteth three Gallants bidden to a wedding-feast, anddetaineth one.     It is an ancient Mariner,     And he stoppeth one of three.     `By thy long beard and glittering eye,     Now wherefore stopp'st thou me ?     The Bridegroom's doors are opened wide,     And I am next of kin ;     The guests are met, the feast is set :     May'st hear the merry din.'     He holds him with his skinny hand,     `There was a ship,' quoth he.     `Hold off ! unhand me, grey-beard loon !'     Eftsoons his hand dropt he.The Wedding-Guest is spell-bound by the eye of the old seafaring man, andconstrained to hear his tale.     He holds him with his glittering eye--     The Wedding-Guest stood still,     And listens like a three years' child :     The Mariner hath his will.     The Wedding-Guest sat on a stone :     He cannot choose but hear ;     And thus spake on that ancient man,     The bright-eyed Mariner.     `The ship was cheered, the harbour cleared,     Merrily did we drop     Below the kirk, below the hill,     Below the lighthouse top.The Mariner tells how the ship sailed southward with a good wind and fairweather, till it reached the Line.     The Sun came up upon the left,     Out of the sea came he !     And he shone bright, and on the right     Went down into the sea.     Higher and higher every day,     Till over the mast at noon--'     The Wedding-Guest here beat his breast,     For he heard the loud bassoon.The Wedding-Guest heareth the bridal music ; but the Mariner continueth histale.     The bride hath paced into the hall,     Red as a rose is she ;     Nodding their heads before her goes     The merry minstrelsy.     The Wedding-Guest he beat his breast,     Yet he cannot choose but hear ;     And thus spake on that ancient man,     The bright-eyed Mariner.The ship driven by a storm toward the south pole.     `And now the STORM-BLAST came, and he     Was tyrannous and strong :     He struck with his o'ertaking wings,     And chased us south along.     With sloping masts and dipping prow,     As who pursued with yell and blow     Still treads the shadow of his foe,     And forward bends his head,     The ship drove fast, loud roared the blast,     The southward aye we fled.     And now there came both mist and snow,     And it grew wondrous cold :     And ice, mast-high, came floating by,     As green as emerald.The land of ice, and of fearful sounds where no living thing was to beseen.     And through the drifts the snowy clifts     Did send a dismal sheen :     Nor shapes of men nor beasts we ken--     The ice was all between.     The ice was here, the ice was there,     The ice was all around :     It cracked and growled, and roared and howled,     Like noises in a swound !Till a great sea-bird, called the Albatross, came through the snow-fog, andwas received with great joy and hospitality.     At length did cross an Albatross,     Thorough the fog it came ;     As if it had been a Christian soul,     We hailed it in God's name.     It ate the food it ne'er had eat,     And round and round it flew.     The ice did split with a thunder-fit ;     The helmsman steered us through !And lo ! the Albatross proveth a bird of good omen, and followeth the shipas it returned northward through fog and floating ice.     And a good south wind sprung up behind ;     The Albatross did follow,     And every day, for food or play,     Came to the mariner's hollo !     In mist or cloud, on mast or shroud,     It perched for vespers nine ;     Whiles all the night, through fog-smoke white,     Glimmered the white Moon-shine.'The ancient Mariner inhospitably killeth the pious bird of good omen.     `God save thee, ancient Mariner !     From the fiends, that plague thee thus !--     Why look'st thou so ?'--With my cross-bow     I shot the ALBATROSS.PART II     The Sun now rose upon the right :     Out of the sea came he,     Still hid in mist, and on the left     Went down into the sea.     And the good south wind still blew behind,     But no sweet bird did follow,     Nor any day for food or play     Came to the mariners' hollo !His shipmates cry out against the ancient Mariner, for killing the bird ofgood luck.     And I had done an hellish thing,     And it would work 'em woe :     For all averred, I had killed the bird     That made the breeze to blow.     Ah wretch ! said they, the bird to slay,     That made the breeze to blow !But when the fog cleared off, they justify the same, and thus makethemselves accomplices in the crime.     Nor dim nor red, like God's own head,     The glorious Sun uprist :     Then all averred, I had killed the bird     That brought the fog and mist.     'Twas right, said they, such birds to slay,     That bring the fog and mist.The fair breeze continues ; the ship enters the Pacific Ocean, and sailsnorthward, even till it reaches the Line.     The fair breeze blew, the white foam flew,     The furrow followed free ;     We were the first that ever burst     Into that silent sea.The ship hath been suddenly becalmed.     Down dropt the breeze, the sails dropt down,     'Twas sad as sad could be ;     And we did speak only to break     The silence of the sea !     All in a hot and copper sky,     The bloody Sun, at noon,     Right up above the mast did stand,     No bigger than the Moon.     Day after day, day after day,     We stuck, nor breath nor motion ;     As idle as a painted ship     Upon a painted ocean.And the Albatross begins to be avenged.     Water, water, every where,     And all the boards did shrink ;     Water, water, every where,     Nor any drop to drink.     The very deep did rot : O Christ !     That ever this should be !     Yea, slimy things did crawl with legs     Upon the slimy sea.     About, about, in reel and rout     The death-fires danced at night ;     The water, like a witch's oils,     Burnt green, and blue and white.A Spirit had followed them ; one of the invisible inhabitants of thisplanet, neither departed souls nor angels ; concerning whom the learnedJew, Josephus, and the Platonic Constantinopolitan, Michael Psellus, may beconsulted. They are very numerous, and there is no climate or elementwithout one or more.     And some in dreams assuréd were     Of the Spirit that plagued us so ;     Nine fathom deep he had followed us     From the land of mist and snow.     And every tongue, through utter drought,     Was withered at the root ;     We could not speak, no more than if     We had been choked with soot.The shipmates, in their sore distress, would fain throw the whole guilt onthe ancient Mariner : in sign whereof they hang the dead sea-bird round hisneck.     Ah ! well a-day ! what evil looks     Had I from old and young !     Instead of the cross, the Albatross     About my neck was hung.PART III     There passed a weary time. Each throat     Was parched, and glazed each eye.     A weary time ! a weary time !     How glazed each weary eye,     When looking westward, I beheld     A something in the sky.The ancient Mariner beholdeth a sign in the element afar off.     At first it seemed a little speck,     And then it seemed a mist ;     It moved and moved, and took at last     A certain shape, I wist.     A speck, a mist, a shape, I wist !     And still it neared and neared :     As if it dodged a water-sprite,     It plunged and tacked and veered.At its nearer approach, it seemeth him to be a ship ; and at a dear ransomhe freeth his speech from the bonds of thirst.     With throats unslaked, with black lips baked,     We could nor laugh nor wail ;     Through utter drought all dumb we stood !     I bit my arm, I sucked the blood,     And cried, A sail ! a sail !A flash of joy ;     With throats unslaked, with black lips baked,     Agape they heard me call :     Gramercy ! they for joy did grin,     And all at once their breath drew in,     As they were drinking all.And horror follows. For can it be a ship that comes onward without wind ortide ?     See ! see ! (I cried) she tacks no more !     Hither to work us weal ;     Without a breeze, without a tide,     She steadies with upright keel !     The western wave was all a-flame.     The day was well nigh done !     Almost upon the western wave     Rested the broad bright Sun ;     When that strange shape drove suddenly     Betwixt us and the Sun.It seemeth him but the skeleton of a ship.     And straight the Sun was flecked with bars,     (Heaven's Mother send us grace !)     As if through a dungeon-grate he peered     With broad and burning face.And its ribs are seen as bars on the face of the setting Sun.     Alas ! (thought I, and my heart beat loud)     How fast she nears and nears !     Are those her sails that glance in the Sun,     Like restless gossameres ?The Spectre-Woman and her Death-mate, and no other on board the skeletonship.     And those her ribs through which the Sun     Did peer, as through a grate ?     And is that Woman all her crew ?     Is that a DEATH ? and are there two ?     Is DEATH that woman's mate ?[first version of this stanza through the end of Part III]Like vessel, like crew !     Her lips were red, her looks were free,     Her locks were yellow as gold :     Her skin was as white as leprosy,     The Night-mare LIFE-IN-DEATH was she,     Who thicks man's blood with cold.Death and Life-in-Death have diced for the ship's crew, and she (thelatter) winneth the ancient Mariner.     The naked hulk alongside came,     And the twain were casting dice ;     `The game is done ! I've won ! I've won !'     Quoth she, and whistles thrice.No twilight within the courts of the Sun.     The Sun's rim dips ; the stars rush out :     At one stride comes the dark ;     With far-heard whisper, o'er the sea,     Off shot the spectre-bark.At the rising of the Moon,     We listened and looked sideways up !     Fear at my heart, as at a cup,     My life-blood seemed to sip !     The stars were dim, and thick the night,     The steerman's face by his lamp gleamed white ;     From the sails the dew did drip--     Till clomb above the eastern bar     The hornéd Moon, with one bright star     Within the nether tip.One after another,     One after one, by the star-dogged Moon,     Too quick for groan or sigh,     Each turned his face with a ghastly pang,     And cursed me with his eye.His shipmates drop down dead.     Four times fifty living men,     (And I heard nor sigh nor groan)     With heavy thump, a lifeless lump,     They dropped down one by one.But Life-in-Death begins her work on the ancient Mariner.     The souls did from their bodies fly,--     They fled to bliss or woe !     And every soul, it passed me by,     Like the whizz of my cross-bow !PART IVThe Wedding-Guest feareth that a Spirit is talking to him ;     `I fear thee, ancient Mariner !     I fear thy skinny hand !     And thou art long, and lank, and brown,     As is the ribbed sea-sand.(Coleridge's note on above stanza)     I fear thee and thy glittering eye,     And thy skinny hand, so brown.'--     Fear not, fear not, thou Wedding-Guest !     This body dropt not down.But the ancient Mariner assureth him of his bodily life, and proceedeth torelate his horrible penance.     Alone, alone, all, all alone,     Alone on a wide wide sea !     And never a saint took pity on     My soul in agony.He despiseth the creatures of the calm,     The many men, so beautiful !     And they all dead did lie :     And a thousand thousand slimy things     Lived on ; and so did I.And envieth that they should live, and so many lie dead.     I looked upon the rotting sea,     And drew my eyes away ;     I looked upon the rotting deck,     And there the dead men lay.     I looked to heaven, and tried to pray ;     But or ever a prayer had gusht,     A wicked whisper came, and made     My heart as dry as dust.     I closed my lids, and kept them close,     And the balls like pulses beat ;     For the sky and the sea, and the sea and the sky     Lay like a load on my weary eye,     And the dead were at my feet.But the curse liveth for him in the eye of the dead men.     The cold sweat melted from their limbs,     Nor rot nor reek did they :     The look with which they looked on me     Had never passed away.     An orphan's curse would drag to hell     A spirit from on high ;     But oh ! more horrible than that     Is the curse in a dead man's eye !     Seven days, seven nights, I saw that curse,     And yet I could not die.In his loneliness and fixedness he yearneth towards the journeying Moon,and the stars that still sojourn, yet still move onward ; and every wherethe blue sky belongs to them, and is their appointed rest, and their nativecountry and their own natural homes, which they enter unannounced, as lordsthat are certainly expected and yet there is a silent joy at their arrival.     The moving Moon went up the sky,     And no where did abide :     Softly she was going up,     And a star or two beside--     Her beams bemocked the sultry main,     Like April hoar-frost spread ;     But where the ship's huge shadow lay,     The charméd water burnt alway     A still and awful red.By the light of the Moon he beholdeth God's creatures of the great calm.     Beyond the shadow of the ship,     I watched the water-snakes :     They moved in tracks of shining white,     And when they reared, the elfish light     Fell off in hoary flakes.     Within the shadow of the ship     I watched their rich attire :     Blue, glossy green, and velvet black,     They coiled and swam ; and every track     Was a flash of golden fire.Their beauty and their happiness.He blesseth them in his heart.     O happy living things ! no tongue     Their beauty might declare :     A spring of love gushed from my heart,     And I blessed them unaware :     Sure my kind saint took pity on me,     And I blessed them unaware.The spell begins to break.     The self-same moment I could pray ;     And from my neck so free     The Albatross fell off, and sank     Like lead into the sea.PART V     Oh sleep ! it is a gentle thing,     Beloved from pole to pole !     To Mary Queen the praise be given !     She sent the gentle sleep from Heaven,     That slid into my soul.By grace of the holy Mother, the ancient Mariner is refreshed with rain.     The silly buckets on the deck,     That had so long remained,     I dreamt that they were filled with dew ;     And when I awoke, it rained.     My lips were wet, my throat was cold,     My garments all were dank ;     Sure I had drunken in my dreams,     And still my body drank.     I moved, and could not feel my limbs :     I was so light--almost     I thought that I had died in sleep,     And was a blesséd ghost.He heareth sounds and seeth strange sights and commotions in the sky andthe element.     And soon I heard a roaring wind :     It did not come anear ;     But with its sound it shook the sails,     That were so thin and sere.     The upper air burst into life !     And a hundred fire-flags sheen,     To and fro they were hurried about !     And to and fro, and in and out,     The wan stars danced between.     And the coming wind did roar more loud,     And the sails did sigh like sedge ;     And the rain poured down from one black cloud ;     The Moon was at its edge.     The thick black cloud was cleft, and still     The Moon was at its side :     Like waters shot from some high crag,     The lightning fell with never a jag,     A river steep and wide.The bodies of the ship's crew are inspired, and the ship moves on ;     The loud wind never reached the ship,     Yet now the ship moved on !     Beneath the lightning and the Moon     The dead men gave a groan.     They groaned, they stirred, they all uprose,     Nor spake, nor moved their eyes ;     It had been strange, even in a dream,     To have seen those dead men rise.     The helmsman steered, the ship moved on ;     Yet never a breeze up-blew ;     The mariners all 'gan work the ropes,     Where they were wont to do ;     They raised their limbs like lifeless tools--     We were a ghastly crew.     The body of my brother's son     Stood by me, knee to knee :     The body and I pulled at one rope,     But he said nought to me.But not by the souls of the men, nor by dæmons of earth or middle air, butby a blessed troop of angelic spirits, sent down by the invocation of theguardian saint.     `I fear thee, ancient Mariner !'     Be calm, thou Wedding-Guest !     'Twas not those souls that fled in pain,     Which to their corses came again,     But a troop of spirits blest :     For when it dawned--they dropped their arms,     And clustered round the mast ;     Sweet sounds rose slowly through their mouths,     And from their bodies passed.     Around, around, flew each sweet sound,     Then darted to the Sun ;     Slowly the sounds came back again,     Now mixed, now one by one.     Sometimes a-dropping from the sky     I heard the sky-lark sing ;     Sometimes all little birds that are,     How they seemed to fill the sea and air     With their sweet jargoning !     And now 'twas like all instruments,     Now like a lonely flute ;     And now it is an angel's song,     That makes the heavens be mute.     It ceased ; yet still the sails made on     A pleasant noise till noon,     A noise like of a hidden brook     In the leafy month of June,     That to the sleeping woods all night     Singeth a quiet tune.[Additional stanzas, dropped after the first edition.]     Till noon we quietly sailed on,     Yet never a breeze did breathe :     Slowly and smoothly went the ship,     Moved onward from beneath.The lonesome Spirit from the south-pole carries on the ship as far as theLine, in obedience to the angelic troop, but still requireth vengeance.     Under the keel nine fathom deep,     From the land of mist and snow,     The spirit slid : and it was he     That made the ship to go.     The sails at noon left off their tune,     And the ship stood still also.     The Sun, right up above the mast,     Had fixed her to the ocean :     But in a minute she 'gan stir,     With a short uneasy motion--     Backwards and forwards half her length     With a short uneasy motion.     Then like a pawing horse let go,     She made a sudden bound :     It flung the blood into my head,     And I fell down in a swound.The Polar Spirit's fellow-dæmons, the invisible inhabitants of the element,take part in his wrong ; and two of them relate, one to the other, thatpenance long and heavy for the ancient Mariner hath been accorded to thePolar Spirit, who returneth southward.     How long in that same fit I lay,     I have not to declare ;     But ere my living life returned,     I heard and in my soul discerned     Two voices in the air.     `Is it he ?' quoth one, `Is this the man ?     By him who died on cross,     With his cruel bow he laid full low     The harmless Albatross.     The spirit who bideth by himself     In the land of mist and snow,     He loved the bird that loved the man     Who shot him with his bow.'     The other was a softer voice,     As soft as honey-dew :     Quoth he, `The man hath penance done,     And penance more will do.'PART VI     FIRST VOICE     `But tell me, tell me ! speak again,     Thy soft response renewing--     What makes that ship drive on so fast ?     What is the ocean doing ?'     SECOND VOICE     `Still as a slave before his lord,     The ocean hath no blast ;     His great bright eye most silently     Up to the Moon is cast--     If he may know which way to go ;     For she guides him smooth or grim.     See, brother, see ! how graciously     She looketh down on him.'The Mariner hath been cast into a trance ; for the angelic power causeththe vessel to drive northward faster than human life could endure.     FIRST VOICE     `But why drives on that ship so fast,     Without or wave or wind ?'     SECOND VOICE     `The air is cut away before,     And closes from behind.     Fly, brother, fly ! more high, more high !     Or we shall be belated :     For slow and slow that ship will go,     When the Mariner's trance is abated.'The supernatural motion is retarded ; the Mariner awakes, and his penancebegins anew.     I woke, and we were sailing on     As in a gentle weather :     'Twas night, calm night, the moon was high ;     The dead men stood together.     All stood together on the deck,     For a charnel-dungeon fitter :     All fixed on me their stony eyes,     That in the Moon did glitter.     The pang, the curse, with which they died,     Had never passed away :     I could not draw my eyes from theirs,     Nor turn them up to pray.The curse is finally expiated.     And now this spell was snapt : once more     I viewed the ocean green,     And looked far forth, yet little saw     Of what had else been seen--     Like one, that on a lonesome road     Doth walk in fear and dread,     And having once turned round walks on,     And turns no more his head ;     Because he knows, a frightful fiend     Doth close behind him tread.     But soon there breathed a wind on me,     Nor sound nor motion made :     Its path was not upon the sea,     In ripple or in shade.     It raised my hair, it fanned my cheek     Like a meadow-gale of spring--     It mingled strangely with my fears,     Yet it felt like a welcoming.     Swiftly, swiftly flew the ship,     Yet she sailed softly too :     Sweetly, sweetly blew the breeze--     On me alone it blew.And the ancient Mariner beholdeth his native country.     Oh ! dream of joy ! is this indeed     The light-house top I see ?     Is this the hill ? is this the kirk ?     Is this mine own countree ?     We drifted o'er the harbour-bar,     And I with sobs did pray--     O let me be awake, my God !     Or let me sleep alway.     The harbour-bay was clear as glass,     So smoothly it was strewn !     And on the bay the moonlight lay,     And the shadow of the Moon.[Additional stanzas, dropped after the first edition.]     The rock shone bright, the kirk no less,     That stands above the rock :     The moonlight steeped in silentness     The steady weathercock.The angelic spirits leave the dead bodies,     And the bay was white with silent light,     Till rising from the same,     Full many shapes, that shadows were,     In crimson colours came.And appear in their own forms of light.     A little distance from the prow     Those crimson shadows were :     I turned my eyes upon the deck--     Oh, Christ ! what saw I there !     Each corse lay flat, lifeless and flat,     And, by the holy rood !     A man all light, a seraph-man,     On every corse there stood.     This seraph-band, each waved his hand :     It was a heavenly sight !     They stood as signals to the land,     Each one a lovely light ;     This seraph-band, each waved his hand,     No voice did they impart--     No voice ; but oh ! the silence sank     Like music on my heart.     But soon I heard the dash of oars,     I heard the Pilot's cheer ;     My head was turned perforce away     And I saw a boat appear.[Additional stanza, dropped after the first edition.]     The Pilot and the Pilot's boy,     I heard them coming fast :     Dear Lord in Heaven ! it was a joy     The dead men could not blast.     I saw a third--I heard his voice :     It is the Hermit good !     He singeth loud his godly hymns     That he makes in the wood.     He'll shrieve my soul, he'll wash away     The Albatross's blood.PART VIIThe Hermit of the Wood,     This Hermit good lives in that wood     Which slopes down to the sea.     How loudly his sweet voice he rears !     He loves to talk with marineres     That come from a far countree.     He kneels at morn, and noon, and eve--     He hath a cushion plump :     It is the moss that wholly hides     The rotted old oak-stump.     The skiff-boat neared : I heard them talk,     `Why, this is strange, I trow !     Where are those lights so many and fair,     That signal made but now ?'Approacheth the ship with wonder.     `Strange, by my faith !' the Hermit said--     `And they answered not our cheer !     The planks looked warped ! and see those sails,     How thin they are and sere !     I never saw aught like to them,     Unless perchance it were     Brown skeletons of leaves that lag     My forest-brook along ;     When the ivy-tod is heavy with snow,     And the owlet whoops to the wolf below,     That eats the she-wolf's young.'     `Dear Lord ! it hath a fiendish look--     (The Pilot made reply)     I am a-feared'--`Push on, push on !'     Said the Hermit cheerily.     The boat came closer to the ship,     But I nor spake nor stirred ;     The boat came close beneath the ship,     And straight a sound was heard.The ship suddenly sinketh.     Under the water it rumbled on,     Still louder and more dread :     It reached the ship, it split the bay ;     The ship went down like lead.The ancient Mariner is saved in the Pilot's boat.     Stunned by that loud and dreadful sound,     Which sky and ocean smote,     Like one that hath been seven days drowned     My body lay afloat ;     But swift as dreams, myself I found     Within the Pilot's boat.     Upon the whirl, where sank the ship,     The boat spun round and round ;     And all was still, save that the hill     Was telling of the sound.     I moved my lips--the Pilot shrieked     And fell down in a fit ;     The holy Hermit raised his eyes,     And prayed where he did sit.     I took the oars : the Pilot's boy,     Who now doth crazy go,     Laughed loud and long, and all the while     His eyes went to and fro.     `Ha ! ha !' quoth he, `full plain I see,     The Devil knows how to row.'     And now, all in my own countree,     I stood on the firm land !     The Hermit stepped forth from the boat,     And scarcely he could stand.The ancient Mariner earnestly entreateth the Hermit to shrieve him ; andthe penance of life falls on him.     `O shrieve me, shrieve me, holy man !'     The Hermit crossed his brow.     `Say quick,' quoth he, `I bid thee say--     What manner of man art thou ?'     Forthwith this frame of mine was wrenched     With a woful agony,     Which forced me to begin my tale ;     And then it left me free.And ever and anon through out his future life an agony constraineth him totravel from land to land ;     Since then, at an uncertain hour,     That agony returns :     And till my ghastly tale is told,     This heart within me burns.     I pass, like night, from land to land ;     I have strange power of speech ;     That moment that his face I see,     I know the man that must hear me :     To him my tale I teach.     What loud uproar bursts from that door !     The wedding-guests are there :     But in the garden-bower the bride     And bride-maids singing are :     And hark the little vesper bell,     Which biddeth me to prayer !     O Wedding-Guest ! this soul hath been     Alone on a wide wide sea :     So lonely 'twas, that God himself     Scarce seeméd there to be.     O sweeter than the marriage-feast,     'Tis sweeter far to me,     To walk together to the kirk     With a goodly company !--     To walk together to the kirk,     And all together pray,     While each to his great Father bends,     Old men, and babes, and loving friends     And youths and maidens gay !And to teach, by his own example, love and reverence to all things that Godmade and loveth.     Farewell, farewell ! but this I tell     To thee, thou Wedding-Guest !     He prayeth well, who loveth well     Both man and bird and beast.     He prayeth best, who loveth best     All things both great and small ;     For the dear God who loveth us,     He made and loveth all.     The Mariner, whose eye is bright,     Whose beard with age is hoar,     Is gone : and now the Wedding-Guest     Turned from the bridegroom's door.     He went like one that hath been stunned,     And is of sense forlorn :     A sadder and a wiser man,     He rose the morrow morn. 
                        

                        The sea is a hungry dog, Giant and grey.He rolls on the beach all day.With his clashing teeth and shaggy jawsHour upon hour he gnawsThe rumbling, tumbling stones, And 'Bones, bones, bones, bones! 'The giant sea-dog moans, Licking his greasy paws.And when the night wind roarsAnd the moon rocks in the stormy cloud, He bounds to his feet and snuffs and sniffs, Shaking his wet sides over the cliffs, And howls and hollos long and loud.But on quiet days in May or June, When even the grasses on the dunePlay no more their reedy tune, With his head between his pawsHe lies on the sandy shores, So quiet, so quiet, he scarcely snores.

                        Here's the rule for what to do If ever your teacher has the flu Or for some other reason takes to her bed And a different teacher comes instead When the visiting teacher hangs up her hat Writes the date on the board, does this or that Always remember, you have to say this, OUR teacher never does that, Miss! When you want to change places or wander about Or feel like getting the guinea pig out Never forget, the message is this, OUR teacher always lets us, Miss! Then, when your teacher returns next day And complains about the paint or clay Remember these words, you just say this: That OTHER teacher told us to, Miss! 
                        

                        Be with those who help your being.Don't sit with indifferent people, whose breathcomes cold out of their mouths.Not these visible forms, your work is deeper. A chunk of dirt thrown in the air breaks to pieces.If you don't try to fly,and so break yourself apart,you will be broken open by death,when it's too late for all you could become. Leaves get yellow. The tree puts out fresh rootsand makes them green.Why are you so content with a love that turns you yellow? 
                        

                        Like the touch of rain she wasOn a man's flesh and hair and eyesWhen the joy of walking thusHas taken him by surprise:With the love of the storm he burns,He sings, he laughs, well I know how,But forgets when he returnsAs I shall not forget her 'Go now'.Those two words shut a doorBetween me and the blessed rainThat was never shut beforeAnd will not open again. 
                        

                        In the sky there is nobody asleep. Nobody, nobody.Nobody is asleep.The creatures of the moon sniff and prowl about their cabins.The living iguanas will come and bite the men who do not dream,and the man who rushes out with his spirit broken will meet on the street cornerthe unbelievable alligator quiet beneath the tender protest of thestars.Nobody is asleep on earth. Nobody, nobody.Nobody is asleep.In a graveyard far off there is a corpsewho has moaned for three yearsbecause of a dry countryside on his knee;and that boy they buried this morning cried so muchit was necessary to call out the dogs to keep him quiet.Life is not a dream. Careful! Careful! Careful!We fall down the stairs in order to eat the moist earthor we climb to the knife edge of the snow with the voices of the deaddahlias.But forgetfulness does not exist, dreams do not exist;flesh exists. Kisses tie our mouthsin a thicket of new veins,and whoever his pain pains will feel that pain foreverand whoever is afraid of death will carry it on his shoulders.One day the horses will live in the saloonsand the enraged antswill throw themselves on the yellow skies that take refuge in theeyes of cows.Another daywe will watch the preserved butterflies rise from the deadand still walking through a country of gray sponges and silent boatswe will watch our ring flash and roses spring from our tongue.Careful! Be careful! Be careful!The men who still have marks of the claw and the thunderstorm,and that boy who cries because he has never heard of the invention of the bridge,or that dead man who possesses now only his head and a shoe,we must carry them to the wall where the iguanas and the snakesare waiting,where the bear's teeth are waiting,where the mummified hand of the boy is waiting,and the hair of the camel stands on end with a violent blue shudder.Nobody is sleeping in the sky. Nobody, nobody.Nobody is sleeping.If someone does close his eyes,a whip, boys, a whip!Let there be a landscape of open eyesand bitter wounds on fire.No one is sleeping in this world. No one, no one.I have said it before.No one is sleeping.But if someone grows too much moss on his temples during thenight,open the stage trapdoors so he can see in the moonlightthe lying goblets, and the poison, and the skull of the theaters. 
                        

                        Last night as I was sleeping,I dreamt—marvelous error!—that a spring was breakingout in my heart.I said: Along which secret aqueduct,Oh water, are you coming to me,water of a new lifethat I have never drunk?Last night as I was sleeping,I dreamt—marvelous error!—that I had a beehivehere inside my heart.And the golden beeswere making white combsand sweet honeyfrom my old failures.Last night as I was sleeping,I dreamt—marvelous error!—that a fiery sun was givinglight inside my heart.It was fiery because I feltwarmth as from a hearth,and sun because it gave lightand brought tears to my eyes.Last night as I slept,I dreamt—marvelous error!—that it was God I hadhere inside my heart. 
                        

                        A poem should be palpable and muteAs a globed fruitDumbAs old medallions to the thumbSilent as the sleeve-worn stoneOf casement ledges where the moss has grown -A poem should be wordlessAs the flight of birdsA poem should be motionless in timeAs the moon climbsLeaving, as the moon releasesTwig by twig the night-entangled trees,Leaving, as the moon behind the winter leaves,Memory by memory the mind -A poem should be motionless in timeAs the moon climbsA poem should be equal to:Not trueFor all the history of griefAn empty doorway and a maple leafFor loveThe leaning grasses and two lights above the sea -A poem should not meanBut be 
                        

                        Once, at night, in the manor wood   My Love and I long silent stood,   Amazed that any heavens couldDecree to part us, bitterly repining.   My Love, in aimless love and grief,   Reached forth and drew aside a leaf   That just above us played the thiefAnd stole our starlight that for us was shining.   A star that had remarked her pain   Shone straightway down that leafy lane,   And wrought his image, mirror-plain,Within a tear that on her lash hung gleaming.   "Thus Time," I cried, "is but a tear   Some one hath wept 'twixt hope and fear,   Yet in his little lucent sphereOur star of stars, Eternity, is beaming." 
                        

                        It's coming through a hole in the air,from those nights in Tiananmen Square.It's coming from the feelthat it ain't exactly real,or it's real, but it ain't exactly there.From the wars against disorder,from the sirens night and day,from the fires of the homeless,from the ashes of the gay:Democracy is coming to the U.S.A. 
                        

                        To grow old is to lose everything. Aging, everybody knows it. Even when we are young, we glimpse it sometimes, and nod our heads when a grandfather dies.Then we row for years on the midsummer pond, ignorant and content. But a marriage,that began without harm, scatters into debris on the shore, and a friend from school drops cold on a rocky strand.If a new love carries us past middle age, our wife will die at her strongest and most beautiful. New women come and go. All go. The pretty lover who announces that she is temporaryis temporary. The bold woman,middle-aged against our old age,sinks under an anxiety she cannot withstand. Another friend of decades estranges himself in words that pollute thirty years. Let us stifle under mud at the pond's edge and affirm that it is fittingand delicious to lose everything. 
                        

                        YES, write, if you want to, there's nothing like trying;     Who knows what a treasure your casket may hold?     I'll show you that rhyming's as easy as lying,     If you'll listen to me while the art I unfold.     Here's a book full of words; one can choose as he fancies,     As a painter his tint, as a workman his tool;     Just think! all the poems and plays and romances     Were drawn out of this, like the fish from a pool!     You can wander at will through its syllabled mazes,     And take all you want, not a copper they cost,--     What is there to hinder your picking out phrases     For an epic as clever as "Paradise Lost"?     Don't mind if the index of sense is at zero,     Use words that run smoothly, whatever they mean;     Leander and Lilian and Lillibullero     Are much the same thing in the rhyming machine.     There are words so delicious their sweetness will smother     That boarding-school flavor of which we're afraid,     There is "lush"is a good one, and "swirl" is another,--     Put both in one stanza, its fortune is made.     With musical murmurs and rhythmical closes     You can cheat us of smiles when you've nothing to tell     You hand us a nosegay of milliner's roses,      And we cry with delight, "Oh, how sweet they do smell!"     Perhaps you will answer all needful conditions     For winning the laurels to which you aspire,     By docking the tails of the two prepositions     I' the style o' the bards you so greatly admire.     As for subjects of verse, they are only too plenty     For ringing the changes on metrical chimes;     A maiden, a moonbeam, a lover of twenty      Have filled that great basket with bushels of rhymes.     Let me show you a picture--'t is far from irrelevant--     By a famous old hand in the arts of design;     'T is only a photographed sketch of an elephant,--     The name of the draughtsman was Rembrandt of Rhine.     How easy! no troublesome colors to lay on,     It can't have fatigued him,-- no, not in the least,--     A dash here and there with a haphazard crayon,     And there stands the wrinkled-skinned, baggy-limbed beast.     Just so with your verse,-- 't is as easy as sketching,--     You can reel off a song without knitting your brow,     As lightly as Rembrandt a drawing or etching;     It is nothing at all, if you only know how.     Well; imagine you've printed your volume of verses:     Your forehead is wreathed with the garland of fame,     Your poems the eloquent school-boy rehearses,     Her album the school-girl presents for your name;     Each morning the post brings you autograph letters;     You'll answer them promptly,-- an hour isn't much     For the honor of sharing a page with your betters,     With magistrates, members of Congress, and such.     Of course you're delighted to serve the committees     That come with requests from the country all round,     You would grace the occasion with poems and ditties     When they've got a new schoolhouse, or poorhouse, or pound.     With a hymn for the saints and a song for the sinners,     You go and are welcome wherever you please;     You're a privileged guest at all manner of dinners,     You've a seat on the platform among the grandees.     At length your mere presence becomes a sensation,     Your cup of enjoyment is filled to its brim      With the pleasure Horatian of digitmonstration,     As the whisper runs round of "That's he!" or "That's him!"     But remember, O dealer in phrases sonorous,     So daintily chosen, so tunefully matched,     Though you soar with the wings of the cherubim o'er us,     The ovum was human from which you were hatched.     No will of your own with its puny compulsion     Can summon the spirit that quickens the lyre;     It comes, if at all, like the Sibyl's convulsion     And touches the brain with a finger of fire.     So perhaps, after all, it's as well to he quiet     If you've nothing you think is worth saying in prose,     As to furnish a meal of their cannibal diet     To the critics, by publishing, as you propose.     But it's all of no use, and I'm sorry I've written,--     I shall see your thin volume some day on my shelf;     For the rhyming tarantula surely has bitten,     And music must cure you, so pipe it yourself. 
                        

                        O lonely heart so timid of approach, Like the shy tropic flower that shuts its lips To the faint touch of tender finger tips: What is your word? What question would you broach? Your lustrous-warm eyes are too sadly kind To mask the meaning of your dreamy tale, Your guarded life too exquisitely frail Against the daggers of my warring mind. There is no part of the unyielding earth, Even bare rocks where the eagles build their nest, Will give us undisturbed and friendly rest. No dewfall softens this vast belt of dearth. But in the socket-chiseled teeth of strife, That gleam in serried files in all the lands, We may join hungry, understanding hands, And drink our share of ardent love and life. 
                        

                        In contact, lo! the flint and steel,  By sharp and flame, the thought reveal  That he the metal, she the stone,  Had cherished secretly alone. 
                        

                        Birdsong brings reliefto my longingI'm just as ecstatic as they are,but with nothing to say!Please universal soul, practicesome song or something through me! 
                        

                        It lies not in our power to love or hate,For will in us is over-rul'd by fate.hen two are stript long ere the course begin,We wish that one should lose, the other win;And one especially do we affectOf two gold ingots, like in each respect:The reason no man knows; let it suffice,What we behold is censur'd by our eyes.Where both deliberate, the love is slight:Who ever lov'd, that lov'd not at first sight.

                        A barefoot boy! I mark him at his play -- For May is here once more, and so is he, -- His dusty trousers, rolled half to the knee, And his bare ankles grimy, too, as they: Cross-hatchings of the nettle, in array Of feverish stripes, hint vividly to me Of woody pathways winding endlessly Along the creek, where even yesterday He plunged his shrinking body -- gasped and shook -- Yet called the water 'warm,' with never lack Of joy. And so, half enviously I look Upon this graceless barefoot and his track, -- His toe stubbed -- ay, his big toe-nail knocked back Like unto the clasp of an old pocketbook. 
                        

                        I had eight birds hatched in one nest,Four cocks there were, and hens the rest.I nursed them up with pain and care,Nor cost, nor labour did I spare,Till at the last they felt their wing,Mounted the trees, and learned to sing;Chief of the brood then took his flightTo regions far and left me quite.My mournful chirps I after send,Till he return, or I do end:Leave not thy nest, thy dam and sire,Fly back and sing amidst this choir.My second bird did take her flight,And with her mate flew out of sight;Southward they both their course did bend,And seasons twain they there did spend,Till after blown by southern gales,They norward steered with filled sails.A prettier bird was no where seen,Along the beach among the treen.I have a third of colour white,On whom I placed no small delight;Coupled with mate loving and true,Hath also bid her dam adieu;And where Aurora first appears,She now hath perched to spend her years.One to the academy flewTo chat among that learned crew;Ambition moves still in his breastThat he might chant above the restStriving for more than to do well,That nightingales he might excel.My fifth, whose down is yet scarce gone,Is 'mongst the shrubs and bushes flown,And as his wings increase in strength,On higher boughs he'll perch at length.My other three still with me nest,Until they're grown, then as the rest,Or here or there they'll take their flight,As is ordained, so shall they light.If birds could weep, then would my tearsLet others know what are my fearsLest this my brood some harm should catch,And be surprised for want of watch,Whilst pecking corn and void of care,They fall un'wares in fowler's snare,Or whilst on trees they sit and sing,Some untoward boy at them do fling,Or whilst allured with bell and glass,The net be spread, and caught, alas.Or lest by lime-twigs they be foiled,Or by some greedy hawks be spoiled.O would my young, ye saw my breast,And knew what thoughts there sadly rest,Great was my pain when I you fed,Long did I keep you soft and warm,And with my wings kept off all harm,My cares are more and fears than ever,My throbs such now as 'fore were never.Alas, my birds, you wisdom want,Of perils you are ignorant;Oft times in grass, on trees, in flight,Sore accidents on you may light.O to your safety have an eye,So happy may you live and die.Meanwhile my days in tunes I'll spend,Till my weak lays with me shall end.In shady woods I'll sit and sing,And things that past to mind I'll bring.Once young and pleasant, as are you,But former toys (no joys) adieu.My age I will not once lament,But sing, my time so near is spent.And from the top bough take my flightInto a country beyond sight,Where old ones instantly grow young,And there with seraphims set song;No seasons cold, nor storms they see;But spring lasts to eternity.When each of you shall in your nestAmong your young ones take your rest,In chirping language, oft them tell,You had a dam that loved you well,That did what could be done for young,And nursed you up till you were strong,And 'fore she once would let you fly,She showed you joy and misery;Taught what was good, and what was ill,What would save life, and what would kill.Thus gone, amongst you I may live,And dead, yet speak, and counsel give:Farewell, my birds, farewell adieu,I happy am, if well with you. 
                        

                        Some -thus not all. Not even the majority of all but the minority.Not counting schools, where one has to,and the poets themselves, there might be two people per thousand.Like -but one also likes chicken soup with noodles, one likes compliments and the color blue, one likes an old scarf, one likes having the upper hand, one likes stroking a dog.Poetry -but what is poetry. Many shaky answershave been given to this question.But I don't know and don't know and hold on to it like to a sustaining railing.Translated by Regina Grol 
                        

                        To him who in the love of nature holdsCommunion with her visible forms, she speaksA various language; for his gayer hoursShe has a voice of gladness, and a smileAnd eloquence of beauty; and she glidesInto his darker musings, with a mildAnd healing sympathy that steals awayTheir sharpness ere he is aware. When thoughtsOf the last bitter hour come like a blightOver thy spirit, and sad imagesOf the stern agony, and shroud, and pall,And breathless darkness, and the narrow house,Make thee to shudder, and grow sick at heart;--Go forth, under the open sky, and listTo Nature's teachings, while from all around--Earth and her waters, and the depths of air--Comes a still voice. Yet a few days, and theeThe all-beholding sun shall see no moreIn all his course; nor yet in the cold ground,Where thy pale form was laid, with many tears,Nor in the embrace of ocean, shall existThy image. Earth, that nourished thee, shall claimThy growth, to be resolved to earth again,And, lost each human trace, surrendering upThine individual being, shalt thou go To mix forever with the elements,To be a brother to the insensible rockAnd to the sluggish clod, which the rude swainTurns with his share, and treads upon. The oakShall send his roots abroad, and pierce thy mold. Yet not to thine eternal resting-placeShalt thou retire alone, nor couldst thou wishCouch more magnificent. Thou shalt lie downWith patriarchs of the infant world -- with kings,The powerful of the earth -- the wise, the good,Fair forms, and hoary seers of ages past,All in one mighty sepulchre. The hillsRock-ribbed and ancient as the sun, -- the valesStretching in pensive quietness between;The venerable woods -- rivers that moveIn majesty, and the complaining brooksThat make the meadows green; and, poured round all,Old Ocean's gray and melancholy waste,--Are but the solemn decorations allOf the great tomb of man. The golden sun,The planets, all the infinite host of heaven,Are shining on the sad abodes of deathThrough the still lapse of ages. All that treadThe globe are but a handful to the tribesThat slumber in its bosom. -- Take the wingsOf morning, pierce the Barcan wilderness,Or lose thyself in the continuous woodsWhere rolls the Oregon, and hears no sound,Save his own dashings -- yet the dead are there:And millions in those solitudes, since firstThe flight of years began, have laid them downIn their last sleep -- the dead reign there alone. So shalt thou rest -- and what if thou withdrawIn silence from the living, and no friendTake note of thy departure? All that breatheWill share thy destiny. The gay will laughWhen thou art gone, the solemn brood of carePlod on, and each one as before will chaseHis favorite phantom; yet all these shall leaveTheir mirth and their employments, and shall comeAnd make their bed with thee. As the long trainOf ages glides away, the sons of men--The youth in life's fresh spring, and he who goesIn the full strength of years, matron and maid,The speechless babe, and the gray-headed man--Shall one by one be gathered to thy side,By those, who in their turn, shall follow them. So live, that when thy summons comes to joinThe innumerable caravan, which movesTo that mysterious realm, where each shall takeHis chamber in the silent halls of death,Thou go not, like the quarry-slave at night,Scourged to his dungeon, but, sustained and soothedBy an unfaltering trust, approach thy graveLike one who wraps the drapery of his couchAbout him, and lies down to pleasant dreams. 
                        

                        Be still, my soul, be still; the arms you bear are brittle, Earth and high heaven are fixt of old and founded strong. Think rather,-- call to thought, if now you grieve a little, The days when we had rest, O soul, for they were long. Men loved unkindness then, but lightless in the quarry I slept and saw not; tears fell down, I did not mourn; Sweat ran and blood sprang out and I was never sorry: Then it was well with me, in days ere I was born. Now, and I muse for why and never find the reason, I pace the earth, and drink the air, and feel the sun. Be still, be still, my soul; it is but for a season: Let us endure an hour and see injustice done. Ay, look: high heaven and earth ail from the prime foundation; All thoughts to rive the heart are here, and all are vain: Horror and scorn and hate and fear and indignation-- Oh why did I awake? when shall I sleep again?

                        I know it's a bad titlebut I'm giving it to myself as a gifton a day nearly canceled by sunlightwhen the entire hill is approachingthe ideal of Virginiabrochured with goldenrod and loblollyand I think "at least I have not woken upwith a bloody knife in my hand"by then having absently wanderedone hundred yards from the housewhile still seated in this chairwith my eyes closed.It is a certain hillthe one I imagine when I hear the word "hill"and if the apocalypse turns outto be a world-wide nervous breakdownif our five billion minds collapse at oncewell I'd call that a surprise endingand this hill would still be beautifula place I wouldn't mind dyingalone or with you.I am trying to get at somethingand I want to talk very plainly to youso that we are both comforted by the honesty.You see there is a window by my deskI stare out when I am stuckthough the outdoors has rarely inspired me to writeand I don't know why I keep staring at it.My childhood hasn't made good material eithermostly being a mulch of white minuteswith a few stand out moments,popping tar bubbles on the driveway in the summera certain amount of pride at schooleverytime they called it "our sun"and playing football when the only playwas "go out long" are what stand out now.If squeezed for more informationI can remember old clock radioswith flipping metal numbersand an entree called Surf and Turf.As a way of getting in touch with my originsevery night I set the alarm clockfor the time I was born so that waking upbecomes a historical reenactment and the first thing I do     is take a reading of the day and try to flow with it like     when you're riding a mechanical bull and you strain to learn     the pattern quickly so you don't inadverantly resist it.II twoI can't remember being bornand no one else can remember it eithereven the doctor who I met years laterat a cocktail party.It's one of the little disappointmentsthat makes you think about getting awaygoing to Holly Springs or Coral Gablesand taking a room on the squarewith a landlady whose hands are scoredby disinfectant, telling the people you meetthat you are from Alaska, and listento what they have to say about Alaskauntil you have learned much more about Alaskathan you ever will about Holly Springs or Coral Gables.Sometimes I am buying a newspaperin a strange city and think"I am about to learn what it's like to live here."Oftentimes there is a news itemabout the complaints of homeownerswho live beside the airportand I realize that I read an articleon this subject nearly once a yearand always receive the same image.I am in bed late at nightin my house near the airportlistening to the jets fly overheada strange wife sleeping beside me.In my mind, the bedroom is an amalgamationof various cold medicine commercial sets(there is always a box of tissue on the nightstand).I know these recurring news articles are clues,flaws in the design though I haven't figured outhow to string them together yet,but I've begun to notice that the same peopleare dying over and over again,for instance Minnie Pearlwho died this yearfor the fourth time in four years.III threeToday is the first day of Lentand once again I'm not really sure what it is.How many more years will I let passbefore I take the trouble to ask someone?It reminds of this morningwhen you were getting ready for work.I was sitting by the space heaternumbly watching you dressand when you asked why I never wear a robeI had so many good reasonsI didn't know where to begin.If you were cool in high schoolyou didn't ask too many questions.You could tell who'd been to last night'sbig metal concert by the new t-shirts in the hallway.You didn't have to askand that's what cool was:the ability to deductto know without asking.And the pressure to simulate coolnessmeans not asking when you don't know,which is why kids grow ever more stupid.A yearbook's endpages, filled with promisesto stay in touch, stand as proof of the uselessnessof a teenager's promise. Not like I'm dyingfor a letter from the class stonerten years on but...Do you remember the way the girlswould call out "love you!"conveniently leaving out the "I"as if they didn't want to committo their own declarations.I agree that the "I" is a pretty heavy conceptand hope you won't get uncomfortableif I should go into some deeper stuff here.IV fourThere are things I've given up onlike recording funny answering machine messages.It's part of growing olderand the human race as a grouphas matured along the same lines.It seems our comedy dates the quickest.If you laugh out loud at Shakespeare's jokesI hope you won't be insultedif I say you're trying too hard.Even sketches from the original Saturday Night Liveseem slow-witted and obvious now.It's just that our advances are irrepressible.Nowadays little kids can't even set up lemonade stands.It makes people too self-conscious about the past,though try explaining that to a kid.I'm not saying it should be this way.All this new technologywill eventually give us new feelingsthat will never completely displace the old onesleaving everyone feeling quite nervousand split in two.We will travel to Marseven as folks on Earthare still ripping open potato chipbags with their teeth.Why? I don't have the time or intelligenceto make all the connectionslike my friend Gordon(this is a true story)who grew up in Braintree Massachusettsand had never pictured a brain snagged in a treeuntil I brought it up.He'd never broken the name down to its parts.By then it was too late.He had moved to Coral Gables.V fiveThe hill out my window is still looking beautifulsuffused in a kind of gold national park lightand it seems to say,I'm sorry the world could not possiblyuse another poem about Orpheusbut I'm available if you're not workingon a self-portrait or anything.I'm watching my dog have nightmares,twitching and whining on the office floorand I try to imagine what beasthas cornered him in the meadowwhere his dreams are set.I'm just letting the day be what it is:a place for a large number of thingsto gather and interact --not even a place but an occasiona reality for real things.Friends warned me not to get too psychedelicor religious with this piece:"They won't accept it if it's too psychedelicor religious," but these are valid topicsand I'm the one with the dog twitching on the floorpossibly dreaming of methat part of me that would beat a dogfor no good reasonno reason that a dog could see.I am trying to get at something so simplethat I have to talk plainlyso the words don't disfigure itand if it turns out that what I say is untruethen at least let it be harmlesslike a leaky boat in the reedsthat is bothering no one.VI sixI can't trust the accuracy of my own memories,many of them having blended with sentimentaltelephone and margarine commercialsplainly ruined by Madison Avenuethough no one seems to call the advertising world"Madison Avenue" anymore. Have they moved?Let's get an update on this.But first I have some business to take care of.I walked out to the hill behind our housewhich looks positively Alaskan todayand it would be easier to explain thisif I had a picture to show youbut I was with our young dogand he was running through the tall grasslike running through the tall grassis all of life togetheruntil a bird calls or he finds a beer canand that thing fills all the space in his head.You see,his mind can only hold one thought at a timeand when he finally hears me call his namehe looks up and cocks his headand for a single momentmy voice is everything:Self-portrait at 28.Anonymous submission. 
                        

                        Now, God be thanked Who has watched us with His hour, And caught our youth, and wakened us from sleeping, With hand made sure, clear eye, and sharpened power, To turn, as swimmers into cleanness leaping, Glad from a world grown old and cold and weary, Leave the sick hearts that honour could not move, And half-men, and their dirty songs and dreary, And all the little emptiness of love! Oh! we, who have known shame, we have found release there, Where there's no ill, no grief, but sleep has mending, Naught broken save this body, lost but breath; Nothing to shake the laughing heart's long peace there But only agony, and that has ending; And the worst friend and enemy is but Death.

                        Not like the brazen giant of Greek fame,With conquering limbs astride from land to land;Here at our sea-washed, sunset gates shall standA mighty woman with a torch, whose flameIs the imprisoned lightning, and her nameMother of Exiles. From her beacon-handGlows world-wide welcome; her mild eyes commandThe air-bridged harbor that twin cities frame."Keep, ancient lands, your storied pomp!" cries sheWith silent lips. "Give me your tired, your poor,Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free,The wretched refuse of your teeming shore.Send these, the homeless, tempest-tost to me,I lift my lamp beside the golden door!" 
                        

                        Wait, for now.Distrust everything, if you have to.But trust the hours.  Haven't theycarried you everywhere, up to now? Personal events will become interesting again.Hair will become interesting.Pain will become interesting.Buds that open out of season will become lovely again.Second-hand gloves will become lovely again,their memories are what give themthe need for other hands.  And the desolationof lovers is the same: that enormous emptinesscarved out of such tiny beings as we areasks to be filled; the needfor the new love is faithfulness to the old. Wait.Don't go too early.You're tired. But everyone's tired.But no one is tired enough.Only wait a while and listen.Music of hair,Music of pain,music of looms weaving all our loves again.Be there to hear it, it will be the only time,most of all to hear,the flute of your whole existence,rehearsed by the sorrows, play itself into total exhaustion. 
                        

                        The houses are hauntedBy white night-gowns.None are green,Or purple with green rings,Or green with yellow rings,Or yellow with blue rings.None of them are strange,With socks of laceAnd beaded ceintures.People are not goingTo dream of baboons and periwinkles.Only, here and there, an old sailor,Drunk and asleep in his boots,Catches TigersIn red weather. 
                        

                        We decided to have the abortion, becamekillers together. The period that camechanged nothing. They were dead, that young couplewho had been for life.As we talked of it in bed, the crashwas not a surprise. We went to the window,looked at the crushed cars and the gleamingcurved shears of glass as if we haddone it. Cops pulled the bodies outBloody as births from the small, smokingaperture of the door, laid themon the hill, covered them with blankets that soakedthrough. Bloodbegan to pourdown my legs into my slippers. I stoodwhere I was until they shot the boundform into the black holeof the ambulance and stood the other oneup, a bandage covering its head,stained where the eyes had been.The next morning I had to kneelan hour on that floor, to clean up my blood,rubbing with wet cloths at those glitteringtranslucent spots, as one has to soaka long time to deglaze the panwhen the feast is over.

                        There's a breathless hush in the Close to-night—Ten to make and the match to win—A bumping pitch and a blinding light,An hour to play and the last man in.And it's not for the sake of a ribboned coat,Or the selfish hope of a season's fame,But his captain's hand on his shoulder smote'Play up! play up! and play the game! 'The sand of the desert is sodden red,—Red with the wreck of a square that broke; —The Gatling's jammed and the Colonel dead,And the regiment blind with dust and smoke.The river of death has brimmed his banks,And England's far, and Honour a name,But the voice of a schoolboy rallies the ranks:'Play up! play up! and play the game! 'This is the word that year by year,While in her place the school is set,Every one of her sons must hear,And none that hears it dare forget.This they all with a joyful mindBear through life like a torch in flame,And falling fling to the host behind—'Play up! play up! and play the game!

                        Jenny kissed me when we met,Jumping from the chair she sat in; Time, you thief, who love to getSweets into your list, put that in! Say I'm weary, say I'm sad,Say that health and wealth have missed me,Say I'm growing old, but add,Jenny kissed me. 
                        

                        From my mother's sleep I fell into the State,And I hunched in its belly till my wet fur froze.Six miles from earth, loosed from its dream of life,I woke to black flak and the nightmare fighters.When I died they washed me out of the turret with a hose.

                        Childhood, sweet and sunny childhood,    With its careless, thoughtless air,Like the verdant, tangled wildwood,    Wants the training hand of care.See it springing all around us --    Glad to know, and quick to learn;Asking questions that confound us;    Teaching lessons in its turn.Who loves not its joyous revel,    Leaping lightly on the lawn,Up the knoll, along the level,    Free and graceful as a fawn?Let it revel; it is nature    Giving to the little dearsStrength of limb, and healthful features,    For the toil of coming years.He who checks a child with terror,    Stops its play, and stills its song,Not alone commits an error,    But a great and moral wrong.Give it play, and never fear it --    Active life is no defect;Never, never break its spirit --    Curb it only to direct.Would you dam the flowing river,    Thinking it would cease to flow?Onward it must go forever --    Better teach it where to go.Childhood is a fountain welling,    Trace its channel in the sand,And its currents, spreading, swelling,    Will revive the withered land.Childhood is the vernal season;    Trim and train the tender shoot;Love is to the coming reason,    As the blossom to the fruit.Tender twigs are bent and folded --    Art to nature beauty lends;Childhood easily is moulded;    Manhood breaks, but seldom bends.

I drop in."Sit down and have a drink" hesays. I drink; we drink. I lookup. "You have SARDINES in it.""Yes, it needed something there.""Oh." I go and the days go byand I drop in again. The paintingis going on, and I go, and the daysgo by. I drop in. The painting isfinished. "Where's SARDINES?"All that's left is justletters, "It was too much," Mike says.But me? One day I am thinking ofa color: orange. I write a lineabout orange. Pretty soon it is awhole page of words, not lines.Then another page. There should beso much more, not of orange, ofwords, of how terrible orange isand life. Days go by. It is even inprose, I am a real poet. My poemis finished and I haven't mentionedorange yet. It's twelve poems, I callit ORANGES. And one day in a galleryI see Mike's painting, called SARDINES. 
                        

                        Whenever I walk to Suffern along the Erie trackI go by a poor old farmhouse with its shingles broken and black.I suppose I've passed it a hundred times, but I always stop for a minuteAnd look at the house, the tragic house, the house with nobody in it. I never have seen a haunted house, but I hear there are such things;That they hold the talk of spirits, their mirth and sorrowings.I know this house isn't haunted, and I wish it were, I do;For it wouldn't be so lonely if it had a ghost or two. This house on the road to Suffern needs a dozen panes of glass,And somebody ought to weed the walk and take a scythe to the grass.It needs new paint and shingles, and the vines should be trimmed and tied;But what it needs the most of all is some people living inside. If I had a lot of money and all my debts were paidI'd put a gang of men to work with brush and saw and spade.I'd buy that place and fix it up the way it used to beAnd I'd find some people who wanted a home and give it to them free. Now, a new house standing empty, with staring window and door,Looks idle, perhaps, and foolish, like a hat on its block in the store.But there's nothing mournful about it; it cannot be sad and loneFor the lack of something within it that it has never known. But a house that has done what a house should do,  a house that has sheltered life,That has put its loving wooden arms around a man and his wife,A house that has echoed a baby's laugh and held up his stumbling feet,Is the saddest sight, when it's left alone, that ever your eyes could meet. So whenever I go to Suffern along the Erie trackI never go by the empty house without stopping and looking back,Yet it hurts me to look at the crumbling roof and the shutters fallen apart,For I can't help thinking the poor old house is a house with a broken heart. 
                        

                        Some celebrate the beauty   of knights, or infantry, or billowing flotillas   at battle on the sea.Warfare has its glory,    but I place far abovethese military splendors   the one thing that you love.For proof of this contention   examine history: we all remember Helen,    who left her family, her child, and royal husband,    to take a stranger's hand: her beauty had no equal,    but bowed to love's command.As love then is the power   that none can disobey, so too my thoughts must follow   my darling far away: the sparkle of her laughter   would give me greater joythan all the bronze-clad heroes 
                        

                        Genius, like gold and precious stones, is chiefly prized because of its rarity. Geniuses are people who dash of weird, wild, incomprehensible poems with astonishing facility, and get booming drunk and sleep in the gutter. Genius elevates its possessor to ineffable spheres far above the vulgar world and fills his soul with regal contempt for the gross and sordid things of earth. It is probably on account of this that people who have genius do not pay their board, as a general thing. Geniuses are very singular. If you see a young man who has frowsy hair and distraught look, and affects eccentricity in dress, you may set him down for a genius. If he sings about the degeneracy of a world which courts vulgar opulence and neglects brains, he is undoubtedly a genius. If he is too proud to accept assistance, and spurns it with a lordly air at the very same time that he knows he can't make a living to save his life, he is most certainly a genius. If he hangs on and sticks to poetry, notwithstanding sawing wood comes handier to him, he is a true genius. If he throws away every opportunity in life and crushes the affection and the patience of his friends and then protests in sickly rhymes of his hard lot, and finally persists, in spite of the sound advice of persons who have got sense but not any genius, persists in going up some infamous back alley dying in rags and dirt, he is beyond all question a genius. But above all things, to deftly throw the incoherent ravings of insanity into verse and then rush off and get booming drunk, is the surest of all the different signs of genius. 
                        

                        In a dark time, the eye begins to see, I meet my shadow in the deepening shade; I hear my echo in the echoing wood-- A lord of nature weeping to a tree. I live between the heron and the wren, Beasts of the hill and serpents of the den. What's madness but nobility of soul At odds with circumstance? The day's on fire! I know the purity of pure despair, My shadow pinned against a sweating wall. That place among the rocks--is it a cave, Or a winding path? The edge is what I have. A steady storm of correspondences! A night flowing with birds, a ragged moon, And in broad day the midnight come again! A man goes far to find out what he is-- Death of the self in a long, tearless night, All natural shapes blazing unnatural light. Dark, dark my light, and darker my desire. My soul, like some heat-maddened summer fly, Keeps buzzing at the sill. Which I is I? A fallen man, I climb out of my fear. The mind enters itself, and God the mind, And one is One, free in the tearing wind. 
                        

                        After that hot gospeller has levelled all but the churched sky,I wrote the tale by tallow of a city's death by fire;Under a candle's eye, that smoked in tears, IWanted to tell, in more than wax, of faiths that were snapped like wire.All day I walked abroad among the rubbled tales,Shocked at each wall that stood on the street like a liar;Loud was the bird-rocked sky, and all the clouds were balesTorn open by looting, and white, in spite of the fire.By the smoking sea, where Christ walked, I asked, whyShould a man wax tears, when his wooden world fails?In town, leaves were paper, but the hills were a flock of faiths;To a boy who walked all day, each leaf was a green breathRebuilding a love I thought was dead as nails,Blessing the death and the baptism by fire. 
                        

                        These hearts were woven of human joys and cares, Washed marvellously with sorrow, swift to mirth. The years had given them kindness. Dawn was theirs, And sunset, and the colours of the earth. These had seen movement, and heard music; known Slumber and waking; loved; gone proudly friended; Felt the quick stir of wonder; sat alone; Touched flowers and furs and cheeks. All this is ended. There are waters blown by changing winds to laughter And lit by the rich skies, all day. And after, Frost, with a gesture, stays the waves that dance And wandering loveliness. He leaves a white Unbroken glory, a gathered radiance, A width, a shining peace, under the night. 
                        

                        All day I hear the noise of waters Making moan, Sad as the sea-bird is when, going Forth alone, He hears the winds cry to the water's Monotone. The grey winds, the cold winds are blowing Where I go. I hear the noise of many waters Far below. All day, all night, I hear them flowing To and fro. 
                        

                        All this is flashy rhetoric about loving you.I never had a selfless thought since I was born.I am mercenary and self-seeking through and through:I want God, you, all friends, merely to serve my turn.Peace, re-assurance, pleasure, are the goals I seek,I cannot crawl one inch outside my proper skin:I talk of love --a scholar's parrot may talk Greek--But, self-imprisoned, always end where I begin.Only that now you have taught me (but how late) my lack.I see the chasm. And everything you are was makingMy heart into a bridge by which I might get backFrom exile, and grow man. And now the bridge is breaking.For this I bless you as the ruin falls. The painsYou give me are more precious than all other gains. 
                        

                        Just off the highway to Rochester, Minnesota,Twilight bounds softly forth on the grass.And the eyes of those two Indian poniesDarken with kindness.They have come gladly out of the willowsTo welcome my friend and me.We step over the barbed wire into the pastureWhere they have been grazing all day, alone.They ripple tensely, they can hardly contain their happinessThat we have come.They bow shyly as wet swans. They love each other.There is no loneliness like theirs.At home once more, they begin munching the young tufts of spring in the darkness.I would like to hold the slenderer one in my arms,For she has walked over to meAnd nuzzled my left hand.She is black and white,Her mane falls wild on her forehead,And the light breeze moves me to caress her long earThat is delicate as the skin over a girl's wrist.Suddenly I realizeThat if I stepped out of my body I would breakInto blossom. 
                        

                        The Owl and the Pussy-cat went to seaIn a beautiful pea green boat,They took some honey, and plenty of money,Wrapped up in a five pound note.The Owl looked up to the stars above,And sang to a small guitar,'O lovely Pussy! O Pussy my love,What a beautiful Pussy you are,You are,You are!What a beautiful Pussy you are!'Pussy said to the Owl, 'You elegant fowl!How charmingly sweet you sing!O let us be married! too long we have tarried:But what shall we do for a ring?'They sailed away, for a year and a day,To the land where the Bong-tree growsAnd there in a wood a Piggy-wig stoodWith a ring at the end of his nose,His nose,His nose,With a ring at the end of his nose.'Dear pig, are you willing to sell for one shillingYour ring?' Said the Piggy, 'I will.'So they took it away, and were married next dayBy the Turkey who lives on the hill.They dined on mince, and slices of quince,Which they ate with a runcible spoon;And hand in hand, on the edge of the sand,They danced by the light of the moon,The moon,The moon,They danced by the light of the moon. 
                        

                        Long ago, I was wounded. I livedto revenge myselfagainst my father, notfor what he was--for what I was: from the beginning of time,in childhood, I thoughtthat pain meantI was not loved.It meant I loved. 
                        

                        Just beyond the sunsetSomeone waits for meJust beyond the sunsetLies my destinyWhere the purple mountainsLie in deep tranquillityThere I’ll find the treasureOf love eternally Just beyond the sunsetWaits someone so fairJust beyond the sunsetAll alone they wait thereTheir hair is goldenThe colour of the sandTheir eyes sparkle in the nightLike diamonds in your handJust beyond the sunsetLies a home for meWhere the world is peacefulLike a paradise should beJust beyond the sunsetSomeday is where you’ll find meWritten - July or Aug 1966 
                        

                        There are many cumbersome ways to kill a man.You can make him carry a plank of woodto the top of a hill and nail him to it. To do thisproperly you require a crowd of peoplewearing sandals, a cock that crows, a cloakto dissect, a sponge, some vinegar and oneman to hammer the nails home.Or you can take a length of steel,shaped and chased in a traditional way,and attempt to pierce the metal cage he wears.But for this you need white horses,English trees, men with bows and arrows,at least two flags, a prince, and acastle to hold your banquet in.Dispensing with nobility, you may, if the windallows, blow gas at him. But then you needa mile of mud sliced through with ditches,not to mention black boots, bomb craters,more mud, a plague of rats, a dozen songsand some round hats made of steel.In an age of aeroplanes, you may flymiles above your victim and dispose of him bypressing one small switch. All you thenrequire is an ocean to separate you, twosystems of government, a nation's scientists,several factories, a psychopath andland that no-one needs for several years.These are, as I began, cumbersome waysto kill a man. Simpler, direct, and much more neatis to see that he is living somewhere in the middleof the twentieth century, and leave him there.

                        The boy stood on the burning deck Whence all but he had fled; The flame that lit the battle's wreck Shone round him o'er the dead. Yet beautiful and bright he stood, As born to rule the storm; A creature of heroic blood, A proud, though childlike form. The flames roll'd on...he would not go Without his father's word; That father, faint in death below, His voice no longer heard. He call'd aloud..."Say, father,say If yet my task is done!" He knew not that the chieftain lay Unconscious of his son. "Speak, father!" once again he cried "If I may yet be gone!" And but the booming shots replied, And fast the flames roll'd on. Upon his brow he felt their breath, And in his waving hair, And looked from that lone post of death, In still yet brave despair; And shouted but one more aloud, "My father, must I stay?" While o'er him fast, through sail and shroud The wreathing fires made way, They wrapt the ship in splendour wild, They caught the flag on high, And stream'd above the gallant child, Like banners in the sky. There came a burst of thunder sound... The boy-oh! where was he? Ask of the winds that far around With fragments strewed the sea. With mast, and helm, and pennon fair, That well had borne their part; But the noblest thing which perished there Was that young faithful heart. 
                        

                        Corinna, Pride of Drury-Lane,For whom no Shepherd sighs in vain;Never did Covent Garden boastSo bright a batter'd, strolling Toast;No drunken Rake to pick her up,No Cellar where on Tick to sup;Returning at the Midnight Hour;Four Stories climbing to her Bow'r;Then, seated on a three-legg'd Chair,Takes off her artificial Hair:     Now, picking out a Crystal Eye,She wipes it clean, and lays it by.Her Eye-Brows from a Mouse's Hide,Stuck on with Art on either Side,Pulls off with Care, and first displays 'em, Then in a Play-Book smoothly lays 'em.Now dextrously her Plumpers draws,That serve to fill her hollow Jaws.Untwists a Wire; and from her GumsA Set of Teeth completely comes.Pulls out the Rags contriv'd to propHer flabby Dugs and down they drop.Proceeding on, the lovely GoddessUnlaces next her Steel-Rib'd Bodice;Which by the Operator's Skill,     Press down the Lumps, the Hollows fill,Up hoes her Hand, and off she slipsThe Bolsters that supply her Hips.With gentlest Touch, she next exploresHer Shankers, Issues, running Sores,Effects of many a sad Disaster;And then to each applies a Plaster.But must, before she goes to Bed,Rub off the Daubs of White and Red;And smooth the Furrows in her Front,With greasy Paper stuck upon't.She takes a Bolus e'er she sleeps;And then between two Blankets creeps.With pains of love tormented lies;Or if she chance to close her Eyes,Of Bridewell and the Compter dreams,And feels the Lash, and faintly screams;Or, by a faithless Bully drawn,At some Hedge-Tavern lies in Pawn;Or to Jamaica seems transported,Alone, and by no Planter courted;Or, near Fleet-Ditch's oozy Brinks,Surrounded with a Hundred Stinks,Belated, seems on watch to lie,And snap some Cull passing by;Or, struck with Fear, her Fancy runsOn Watchmen, Constables and Duns,From whom she meets with frequent Rubs;But, never from Religious Clubs;Whose Favour she is sure to find,Because she pays them all in Kind.CORINNA wakes. A dreadful Sight!Behold the Ruins of the Night!A wicked Rat her Plaster stole,Half eat, and dragged it to his Hole.The Crystal Eye, alas, was miss'd;And Puss had on her Plumpers piss'd.A Pigeon pick'd her Issue-Peas;And Shock her Tresses fill'd with Fleas.The Nymph, tho' in this mangled Plight,Must ev'ry Morn her Limbs unite.But how shall I describe her ArtsTo recollect the scatter'd Parts?Or show the Anguish, Toil, and Pain,Of gath'ring up herself again?     The bashful Muse will never bearIn such a Scene to interfere.Corinna in the Morning dizen'd,Who sees, will spew; who smells, be poison'd.Submitted by Andrew Mayers 
                        

                        The war will change many things in art and life, and among them, it is to be hoped, many of our own ideas as to what is, and what is not, "intellectual." Thou, whose deep ways are in the sea, Whose footsteps are not known, To-night a world that turned from Thee Is waiting -- at Thy Throne. The towering Babels that we raised Where scoffing sophists brawl, The little Antichrists we praised -- The night is on them all. The fool hath said . . . The fool hath said . .. And we, who deemed him wise, We who believed that Thou wast dead, How should we seek Thine eyes? How should we seek to Thee for power Who scorned Thee yesterday? How should we kneel, in this dread hour? Lord, teach us how to pray! Grant us the single heart, once more, That mocks no sacred thing, The Sword of Truth our fathers wore When Thou wast Lord and King. Let darkness unto darkness tell Our deep unspoken prayer, For, while our souls in darkness dwell, We know that Thou art there. 
                        

They lie, the men who tell us in a loud decisive tone That want is here a stranger, and that misery's unknown; For where the nearest suburb and the city proper meet My window-sill is level with the faces in the street --     Drifting past, drifting past,     To the beat of weary feet -- While I sorrow for the owners of those faces in the street.  And cause I have to sorrow, in a land so young and fair, To see upon those faces stamped the marks of Want and Care; I look in vain for traces of the fresh and fair and sweet In sallow, sunken faces that are drifting through the street --     Drifting on, drifting on,     To the scrape of restless feet; I can sorrow for the owners of the faces in the street.  In hours before the dawning dims the starlight in the sky The wan and weary faces first begin to trickle by, Increasing as the moments hurry on with morning feet, Till like a pallid river flow the faces in the street --     Flowing in, flowing in,     To the beat of hurried feet -- Ah!  I sorrow for the owners of those faces in the street.  The human river dwindles when 'tis past the hour of eight, Its waves go flowing faster in the fear of being late; But slowly drag the moments, whilst beneath the dust and heat The city grinds the owners of the faces in the street --     Grinding body, grinding soul,     Yielding scarce enough to eat -- Oh!  I sorrow for the owners of the faces in the street.  And then the only faces till the sun is sinking down Are those of outside toilers and the idlers of the town, Save here and there a face that seems a stranger in the street, Tells of the city's unemployed upon his weary beat --     Drifting round, drifting round,     To the tread of listless feet -- Ah!  My heart aches for the owner of that sad face in the street.  And when the hours on lagging feet have slowly dragged away, And sickly yellow gaslights rise to mock the going day, Then flowing past my window like a tide in its retreat, Again I see the pallid stream of faces in the street --     Ebbing out, ebbing out,     To the drag of tired feet, While my heart is aching dumbly for the faces in the street.  And now all blurred and smirched with vice the day's sad pages end, For while the short `large hours' toward the longer `small hours' trend, With smiles that mock the wearer, and with words that half entreat, Delilah pleads for custom at the corner of the street --     Sinking down, sinking down,     Battered wreck by tempests beat -- A dreadful, thankless trade is hers, that Woman of the Street.  But, ah! to dreader things than these our fair young city comes, For in its heart are growing thick the filthy dens and slums, Where human forms shall rot away in sties for swine unmeet, And ghostly faces shall be seen unfit for any street --     Rotting out, rotting out,     For the lack of air and meat -- In dens of vice and horror that are hidden from the street.  I wonder would the apathy of wealthy men endure Were all their windows level with the faces of the Poor? Ah! Mammon's slaves, your knees shall knock, your hearts in terror beat, When God demands a reason for the sorrows of the street,     The wrong things and the bad things     And the sad things that we meet In the filthy lane and alley, and the cruel, heartless street.  I left the dreadful corner where the steps are never still, And sought another window overlooking gorge and hill; But when the night came dreary with the driving rain and sleet, They haunted me -- the shadows of those faces in the street,     Flitting by, flitting by,     Flitting by with noiseless feet, And with cheeks but little paler than the real ones in the street.  Once I cried:  `Oh, God Almighty! if Thy might doth still endure, Now show me in a vision for the wrongs of Earth a cure.' And, lo! with shops all shuttered I beheld a city's street, And in the warning distance heard the tramp of many feet,     Coming near, coming near,     To a drum's dull distant beat, And soon I saw the army that was marching down the street.  Then, like a swollen river that has broken bank and wall, The human flood came pouring with the red flags over all, And kindled eyes all blazing bright with revolution's heat, And flashing swords reflecting rigid faces in the street.     Pouring on, pouring on,     To a drum's loud threatening beat, And the war-hymns and the cheering of the people in the street.  And so it must be while the world goes rolling round its course, The warning pen shall write in vain, the warning voice grow hoarse, But not until a city feels Red Revolution's feet Shall its sad people miss awhile the terrors of the street --     The dreadful everlasting strife     For scarcely clothes and meat In that pent track of living death -- the city's cruel street. 
                        

                        I saw a city filled with lust and shame, Where men, like wolves, slunk through the grim half-light;And sudden, in the midst of it, there came One who spoke boldly for the cause of Right.And speaking, fell before that brutish race Like some poor wren that shrieking eagles tear,While brute Dishonour, with her bloodless face Stood by and smote his lips that moved in prayer."Speak not of God!  In centuries that word Hath not been uttered!  Our own king are we."And God stretched forth his finger as He heard And o'er it cast a thousand leagues of sea. 
                        

                        I behold you as the solitary flowerOn the ends of a branch-letAh, your fragrance travels miles Gratifying even the dull insects! You are a naive pinnate whiteDazzle in your sparkling beauty I know not where I am nowI bid you my earnestly bow! I love you for your delicacyEnthralling my soul with sheer ecstasyI hear something that you whisperVery benignly in my ear! I am so temporary and short livedPlease don't pluck me, don't be rigidI can't move as I am unmovedJust care me in my solitude! Oh, my lovely jasmineI learn a lot from your delicate lifeTake my flying kiss in sublime moodI will bethink you in my solitude! Copyright @poet,24 December,2018 
                        

                        Before dawn wind rushes driving night’s chill westwardso vestiges of darkness send shivers along my spine.Facing east I fight cold’s piercing urge to wince, and huddled await morn’s blush.No wind or cold may dissuademy eyes from pending purchaseof that precious brief pink palette, clouds trimmed in rosy pipingwhich dress the sky at dawn. 
                        

                        They should not have left him there alone, Alone that is except for the cat. He was only nine, not old enough To be left alone in a basement flat, Alone, that is, except for the cat. A dog would have been a different thing, A big gruff dog with slashing jaws, But a cat with round eyes mad as gold, Plump as a cushion with tucked-in paws--- Better have left him with a fair-sized rat! But what they did was leave him with a cat. He hated that cat; he watched it sit, A buzzing machine of soft black stuff, He sat and watched and he hated it, Snug in its fur, hot blood in a muff, And its mad gold stare and the way it sat Crooning dark warmth: he loathed all that. So he took Daddy's stick and he hit the cat. Then quick as a sudden crack in glass It hissed, black flash, to a hiding place In the dust and dark beneath the couch, And he followed the grin on his new-made face, A wide-eyed, frightened snarl of a grin, And he took the stick and he thrust it in, Hard and quick in the furry dark. The black fur squealed and he felt his skin Prickle with sparks of dry delight. Then the cat again came into sight, Shot for the door that wasn't quite shut, But the boy, quick too, slammed fast the door: The cat, half-through, was cracked like a nut And the soft black thud was dumped on the floor. Then the boy was suddenly terrified And he bit his knuckles and cried and cried; But he had to do something with the dead thing there. His eyes squeezed beads of salty prayer But the wound of fear gaped wide and raw; He dared not touch the thing with his hands So he fetched a spade and shovelled it And dumped the load of heavy fur In the spidery cupboard under the stair Where it's been for years, and though it died It's grown in that cupboard and its hot low purr Grows slowly louder year by year: There'll not be a corner for the boy to hide When the cupboard swells and all sides split And the huge black cat pads out of it.Submitted by Andrew Mayers 
                        

                        There is a pleasure in the pathless woods, There is a rapture on the lonely shore, There is society, where none intrudes, By the deep sea, and music in its roar: I love not man the less, but Nature more, From these our interviews, in which I steal From all I may be, or have been before, To mingle with the Universe, and feel What I can ne'er express, yet cannot all conceal. 
                        

                        Listen to me as one listens to the rain,not attentive, not distracted,light footsteps, thin drizzle,water that is air, air that is time,the day is still leaving,the night has yet to arrive,figurations of mistat the turn of the corner,figurations of timeat the bend in this pause,listen to me as one listens to the rain,without listening, hear what I saywith eyes open inward, asleepwith all five senses awake,it's raining, light footsteps, a murmur of syllables,air and water, words with no weight:what we are and are,the days and years, this moment,weightless time and heavy sorrow,listen to me as one listens to the rain,wet asphalt is shining,steam rises and walks away,night unfolds and looks at me,you are you and your body of steam,you and your face of night,you and your hair, unhurried lightning,you cross the street and enter my forehead,footsteps of water across my eyes,listen to me as one listens to the rain,the asphalt's shining, you cross the street,it is the mist, wandering in the night,it is the night, asleep in your bed,it is the surge of waves in your breath,your fingers of water dampen my forehead,your fingers of flame burn my eyes,your fingers of air open eyelids of time,a spring of visions and resurrections,listen to me as one listens to the rain,the years go by, the moments return,do you hear the footsteps in the next room?not here, not there: you hear themin another time that is now,listen to the footsteps of time,inventor of places with no weight, nowhere,listen to the rain running over the terrace,the night is now more night in the grove,lightning has nestled among the leaves,a restless garden adrift-go in,your shadow covers this page. 
                        

                        I wish you were here, dear,I wish you were here. I wish you sat on the sofa and I sat near. The handkerchief could be yours, the tear could be mine, chin-bound. Though it could be, of course, the other way around.I wish you were here, dear, I wish you were here. I wish we were in my car and you'd shift the gear. We'd find ourselves elsewhere, on an unknown shore. Or else we'd repair to where we've been before.I wish you were here, dear, I wish you were here. I wish I knew no astronomy when stars appear, when the moon skims the water that sighs and shifts in its slumber.I wish it were still a quarter to dial your number.I wish you were here, dear, in this hemisphere, as I sit on the porch sipping a beer. It's evening, the sun is setting; boys shout and gulls are crying. What's the point of forgetting if it's followed by dying? 
                        

                        With two white roses on her breasts,     White candles at head and feet, Dark Madonna of the grave she rests;     Lord Death has found her sweet.Her mother pawned her wedding ring    To lay her out in white; She'd be so proud she'd dance and sing    to see herself tonight. 
                        

                            We forget that we are all dead men conversing wtih dead men.                                                                  —Jorge Luis BorgesFor the first time, on the road north of Tampico,I felt the life sliding out of me,a drum in the desert, harder and harder to hear.I was seven, I lay in the carwatching palm trees swirl a sickening pattern past the glass.My stomach was a melon split wide inside my skin.'How do you know if you are going to die?'I begged my mother. We had been traveling for days.With strange confidence she answered,'When you can no longer make a fist.'Years later I smile to think of that journey,the borders we must cross separately,stamped with our unanswerable woes.I who did not die, who am still living,still lying in the backseat behind all my questions,clenching and opening one small hand.

                        My apologies to chance for calling it necessity.My apologies to necessity if I'm mistaken, after all.Please, don't be angry, happiness, that I take you as my due.May my dead be patient with the way my memories fade.My apologies to time for all the world I overlook each second.My apologies to past loves for thinking that the latest is the first.Forgive me, distant wars, for bringing flowers home.Forgive me, open wounds, for pricking my finger.I apologize for my record of minuets to those who cry from the depths.I apologize to those who wait in railway stations for being asleep today at five a.m.Pardon me, hounded hope, for laughing from time to time.Pardon me, deserts, that I don't rush to you bearing a spoonful of water. And you, falcon, unchanging year after year, always in the same cage,your gaze always fixed on the same point in space,forgive me, even if it turns out you were stuffed.My apologies to the felled tree for the table's four legs.My apologies to great questions for small answers.Truth, please don't pay me much attention.Dignity, please be magnanimous.Bear with me, O mystery of existence, as I pluck the occasional thread from your train.Soul, don't take offense that I've only got you now and then.My apologies to everything that I can't be everywhere at once.My apologies to everyone that I can't be each woman and each man.I know I won't be justified as long as I live,since I myself stand in my own way.Don't bear me ill will, speech, that I borrow weighty words,then labor heavily so that they may seem light. 
                        

                        It snowed and snowed ,the whole world over,Snow swept the world from end to end.A candle burned on the table;A candle burned.As during summer midges swarmTo beat their wings against a flameOut in the yard the snowflakes swarmedTo beat against the window paneThe blizzard sculptured on the glassDesigns of arrows and of whorls.A candle burned on the table;A candle burned.Distorted shadows fellUpon the lighted ceiling:Shadows of crossed arms,of crossed legs-Of crossed destiny.Two tiny shoes fell to the floorAnd thudded.A candle on a nightstand shed wax tearsUpon a dress.All things vanished withinThe snowy murk-white,hoary.A candle burned on the table;A candle burned.A corner draft fluttered the flameAnd the white fever of temptationUpswept its angel wings that castA cruciform shadowIt snowed hard throughout the monthOf February, and almost constantlyA candle burned on the table;A candle burned.

                        The room was suddenly rich and the great bay-window wasSpawning snow and pink roses against itSoundlessly collateral and incompatible:World is suddener than we fancy it.World is crazier and more of it than we think,Incorrigibly plural. I peel and portionA tangerine and spit the pips and feelThe drunkenness of things being various.And the fire flames with a bubbling sound for worldIs more spiteful and gay than one supposes–On the tongue on the eyes on the ears in the palms of your hands–There is more than glass between the snow and the huge roses. 
                        

                        Everything’s looted, betrayed and traded,black death’s wing’s overhead.Everything’s eaten by hunger, unsated,so why does a light shine ahead? By day, a mysterious wood, near the town,breathes out cherry, a cherry perfume.By night, on July’s sky, deep, and transparent,new constellations are thrown. And something miraculous will comeclose to the darkness and ruin,something no-one, no-one, has known,though we’ve longed for it since we were children. 
                        

                        Who sat and watched my infant headWhen sleeping on my cradle bed,And tears of sweet affection shed?My Mother.When pain and sickness made me cry,Who gazed upon my heavy eye,And wept for fear that I should die?My Mother.Who taught my infant lips to prayAnd love God’s holy book and day,And walk in wisdom’s pleasant way?My Mother.And can I ever cease to beAffectionate and kind to thee,Who wast so very kind to me,My Mother?Ah, no! the thought I cannot bear,And if God please my life to spareI hope I shall reward they care,My Mother.When thou art feeble, old and grey,My healthy arm shall be thy stay,And I will soothe thy pains away,My Mother.

                        "Delicta juventutis et ignorantius ejus, quoesumus ne memineris, Domine."I left, to earth, a little maiden fair, With locks of gold, and eyes that shamed the light;I prayed that God might have her in His care            And sight.Earth's love was false; her voice, a siren's song; (Sweet mother-earth was but a lying name)The path she showed was but the path of wrong            And shame."Cast her not out!" I cry.  God's kind words come -- "Her future is with Me, as was her past;It shall be My good will to bring her home            At last." 
                        

                        I.No one's serious at seventeen.--On beautiful nights when beer and lemonadeAnd loud, blinding cafés are the last thing you need--You stroll beneath green lindens on the promenade.Lindens smell fine on fine June nights!Sometimes the air is so sweet that you close your eyes;The wind brings sounds--the town is near--And carries scents of vineyards and beer. . .II.--Over there, framed by a branchYou can see a little patch of dark blueStung by a sinister star that fadesWith faint quiverings, so small and white. . .June nights! Seventeen!--Drink it in.Sap is champagne, it goes to your head. . .The mind wanders, you feel a kissOn your lips, quivering like a living thing. . .III.The wild heart Crusoes through a thousand novels--And when a young girl walks alluringlyThrough a streetlamp's pale light, beneath the ominous shadowOf her father's starched collar. . .Because as she passes by, boot heels tapping,She turns on a dime, eyes wide, Finding you too sweet to resist. . .--And cavatinas die on your lips.IV.You're in love. Off the market till August.You're in love.--Your sonnets make Her laugh.Your friends are gone, you're bad news.--Then, one night, your beloved, writes. . .!That night. . .you return to the blinding cafés;You order beer or lemonade. . .--No one's serious at seventeen When lindens line the promenade. 
                        

                        A trusting little leaf of green,  A bold audacious frost; A rendezvous, a kiss or two,  And youth for ever lost.      Ah, me!  The bitter, bitter cost.A flaunting patch of vivid red,  That quivers in the sun; A windy gust, a grave of dust,  The little race is run.      Ah, me!  Were that the only one. 
                        

                        Heavenly cursed and heavily sinned INo more i like to add them, so, I want to dieAnd I want to become a holy ghostWhom the people would like the most.Like the retreating soldiers I like to come backTo my own permanent and eternal home You may call it a suicide or martyrdom.In my real home I see the newsComing from the lipstick coated lips In the television of my molten death People are sobbing with a heavy breath. The atmosphere is heavy and they feel the painThis thrills me and gives a feeling of gain.The only son of my fatherThe only darling of my motherFainted repeatedly on the cushion Peal like tear drops coming from my beloved son, Friends and relatives express grief in the community hall, All these excite  me and I sought to say'' I love you all.''For the first time in my life in my last ritual I listen From those men that  I was really  a very very  good man.In such intense atmosphere of gloom and sad My heart cheers and I become too much glad. < br> < br> < br>death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death death

                        Is it possibleThat so high debate,So sharp, so sore, and of such rate,Should end so soon and was begun so late?Is it possible?Is it possibleSo cruel intent,So hasty heat and so soon spent,From love to hate, and thence for to relent?Is it possible?Is it possibleThat any may findWithin one heart so diverse mind,To change or turn as weather and wind?Is it possible?Is it possibleTo spy it in an eyeThat turns as oft as chance on die,The truth whereof can any try?Is it possible?It is possibleFor to turn so oft,To bring that lowest which was most aloft,And to fall highest yet to light soft:It is possible.All is possibleWhoso list believe.Trust therefore first, and after preve,As men wed ladies by licence and leave.All is possible.

                        They say I looked back out of curiosity.But I could have had other reasons.I looked back mourning my silver bowl.Carelessly, while tying my sandal strap.So I wouldn't have to keep staring at the righteous napeof my husband Lot's neck.From the sudden conviction that if I dropped deadhe wouldn't so much as hesitate.From the disobedience of the meek.Checking for pursuers.Struck by the silence, hoping God had changed his mind.Our two daughters were already vanishing over the hilltop.I felt age within me. Distance.The futility of wandering. Torpor.I looked back setting my bundle down.I looked back not knowing where to set my foot.Serpents appeared on my path,spiders, field mice, baby vultures.They were neither good nor evil now--every living thingwas simply creeping or hopping along in the mass panic.I looked back in desolation.In shame because we had stolen away.Wanting to cry out, to go home.Or only when a sudden gust of windunbound my hair and lifted up my robe.It seemed to me that they were watching from the walls of Sodomand bursting into thunderous laughter again and again.I looked back in anger.To savor their terrible fate.I looked back for all the reasons given above.I looked back involuntarily.It was only a rock that turned underfoot, growling at me.It was a sudden crack that stopped me in my tracks.A hamster on its hind paws tottered on the edge.It was then we both glanced back.No, no. I ran on,I crept, I flew upwarduntil darkness fell from the heavensand with it scorching gravel and dead birds.I couldn't breathe and spun around and around.Anyone who saw me must have thought I was dancing.It's not inconceivable that my eyes were open.It's possible I fell facing the city. 
                        

                        He is more than a hero he is a god in my eyes-- the man who is allowed to sit beside you -- he  who listens intimately to the sweet murmur of your voice, the enticing  laughter that makes my own heart beat fast. If I meet you suddenly, I can'  speak -- my tongue is broken; a thin flame runs under my skin; seeing nothing,  hearing only my own ears drumming, I drip with sweat; trembling shakes my body  and I turn paler than dry grass. At such times death isn't far from me 
                        

                        I come from there and I have memories Born as mortals are, I have a mother And a house with many windows, I have brothers, friends, And a prison cell with a cold window. Mine is the wave, snatched by sea-gulls, I have my own view, And an extra blade of grass. Mine is the moon at the far edge of the words, And the bounty of birds, And the immortal olive tree. I walked this land before the swords Turned its living body into a laden table. I come from there. I render the sky unto her mother When the sky weeps for her mother. And I weep to make myself known To a returning cloud. I learnt all the words worthy of the court of blood So that I could break the rule. I learnt all the words and broke them up To make a single word: Homeland..... 
                        

                        IThe broken pillar of the wing jags from the clotted shoulder,The wing trails like a banner in defeat, No more to use the sky forever but live with famineAnd pain a few days: cat nor coyoteWill shorten the week of waiting for death, there is game without talons.He stands under the oak-bush and waits The lame feet of salvation; at night he remembers freedomAnd flies in a dream, the dawns ruin it. He is strong and pain is worse to the strong, incapacity is worse.The curs of the day come and torment himAt distance, no one but death the redeemer will humble that head, The intrepid readiness, the terrible eyes. The wild God of the world is sometimes merciful to thoseThat ask mercy, not often to the arrogant. You do not know him, you communal people, or you have forgotten him; Intemperate and savage, the hawk remembers him;Beautiful and wild, the hawks, and men that are dying, remember him.                                III'd sooner, except the penalties, kill a man than a hawk; but the great redtailHad nothing left but unable miseryFrom the bone too shattered for mending, the wing that trailed under his talons when he moved. We had fed him six weeks, I gave him freedom,He wandered over the foreland hill and returned in the evening, asking for death,Not like a beggar, still eyed with the oldImplacable arrogance. I gave him the lead gift in the twilight.What fell was relaxed, Owl-downy, soft feminine feathers; but whatSoared: the fierce rush: the night-herons by the flooded river cried fear at its risingBefore it was quite unsheathed from reality. 
                        

                        God's creationBlessed to be born in this worldWe all may feel that's the truthUntil I read this-An abandoned babyMalnourished, hardly an year oldFamine struckSkin and boneNo food to feedNo water to haveStranded alone in barren landHelpless eyes staring straightStanding legs more like a bamboo stickCerebral neurons popping outVeins struggling to carry weak bloodOh God! Nothing more I can add…My heart is not strong enough To read the rest-A vampire vultureSitting beside andLooking eager to end its hunger! I pray! Save these innocents! Let this never happen again! 
                        

                        THE red rose whispers of passion,  And the white rose breathes of love;O, the red rose is a falcon,  And the white rose is a dove.But I send you a cream-white rosebud  With a flush on its petal tips;For the love that is purest and sweetest  Has a kiss of desire on the lips 
                        

                        My mind says - Leave it and proceed! My heart says - Stay and believe, Is it a tug of war between mind and heart?  When life is on crossroads - intrigue and pursues. This is too absurd and at times looks so surreal although my mind is strong and filled with knowledge Whereas, my heart is full of wisdom inspired by experiences  Logic is trying hard to defeat dreams Soul is playing games with body. This tug of war is making life so meaningful, like uneven waves in normally a calm sea. 
                        

                        EVEN such is Time, that takes in trust Our youth, our joys, our all we have, And pays us but with earth and dust;    Who in the dark and silent grave, When we have wander'd all our ways, Shuts up the story of our days; But from this earth, this grave, this dust, My God shall raise me up, I trust. 
                        

                        Don't talk to me of love. I've had an earfulAnd I get tearful when I've downed a drink or two.I'm one of your talking wounded.I'm a hostage. I'm maroonded.But I'm in Paris with you.Yes I'm angry at the way I've been bamboozledAnd resentful at the mess I've been through.I admit I'm on the reboundAnd I don't care where are we bound.I'm in Paris with you.	Do you mind if we do not go to the Louvre	If we say sod off to sodding Notre Dame, 	If we skip the Champs Elysées	And remain here in this sleazy	Old hotel room	Doing this and that	To what and whom	Learning who you are, 	Learning what I am.Don't talk to me of love. Let's talk of Paris, The little bit of Paris in our view.There's that crack across the ceilingAnd the hotel walls are peelingAnd I'm in Paris with you.Don't talk to me of love. Let's talk of Paris.I'm in Paris with the slightest thing you do.I'm in Paris with your eyes, your mouth, I'm in Paris with... all points south.Am I embarrassing you? I'm in Paris with you. 
                        

                        Snow fell in the night.At five-fifteen I woke to a bluishmounded softness where the Honda was. Cat fed and coffee made,I broomed snow off the carand drove to the Kearsarge Mini-Martbefore Amy opened to yank my Globe out of the bundle.Back, I set my cup of coffeebeside Jane, still half-asleep,murmuring stuporousthanks in the aquamarine morning.Then I sat in my blue chair with blueberry bagels and strongblack coffee reading news, the obits, the comics, and the sports.Carrying my cup twenty feet, I sat myself at the deskfor this day's lifelongengagement with the one task and desire. 
                        

                        Why is the world at peace.This may astonish you a little but when you realise howeasily Mrs. Charles Bianco sells the work of Americanpainters to American millionaires you will recognize thatauthorities are constrained to be relieved.  Let me tell you astory.  A painter loved a woman.  A musician did not sing.A South African loved books.  An American was a womanand needed help.  Are Americans the same as incubators.But this is the rest of the story.  He became an authority. 
                        

                        'I thought you loved me.' 'No, it was only fun.''When we stood there, closer than all?' 'Well, the harvest moonWas shining and queer in your hair, and it turned my head.''That made you?' 'Yes.' 'Just the moon and the light it madeUnder the tree?' 'Well, your mouth, too.' 'Yes, my mouth?''And the quiet there that sang like the drum in the booth.You shouldn't have danced like that.' 'Like what?' 'So close,Whith your head turned up, and the flower in your hair, a roseThat smelt all warm.' 'I loved you. I thought you knewI wouldn't have danced like that with any but you.''I didn't know, I thought you knew it was fun.''I thought it was love you meant.' 'Well, it's done.' 'Yes, it's done.I've seen boys stone a blackbird, and watched them drownA kitten... it clawed at the reeds, and they pushed it downInto the pool while it screamed. Is that fun, too?''Well, boys are like that... Your brothers...' 'Yes, I know.But you, so lovely and strong! Not you! Not you!''They don't understand it's cruel. It's only a game.''And are girls fun, too?' 'No, still in a way it's the same.It's queer and lovely to have a girl...' 'Go on.''It makes you mad for a bit to feel she's your own,And you laugh and kiss her, and maybe you give her a ring,But it's only in fun.' 'But I gave you everything.''Well, you shouldn't have done it. You know what a fellow thinksWhen a girl does that.' 'Yes, he talks of her over his drinksAnd calles her a--' 'Stop that now, I thought you knew.''But it wasn't with anyone else. It was only you.''How did I know? I thought you wanted it too.I thought you were like the rest. Well, what's to be done?''To be done' 'Is it all right?' 'Yes.' 'Sure?' 'Yes, but why?''I don't know, I thought you where going to cry.You said you had something to tell me.' 'Yes, I know.It wasn't anything relly... I think I'll go.''Yes, it's late. There's thunder about, a drop of rainFell on my hand in the dark. I'll see you againAt the dance next week. You're sure that everything's right?''Yes,' 'Well, I'll be going.' 'Kiss me...' 'Good night.' ... 'Good night.'

                        A little while, a little while,The weary task is put away,And I can sing and I can smile,Alike, while I have holiday.Why wilt thou go, my harassed heart,What thought, what scene invites thee now?What spot, or near or far,Has rest for thee, my weary brow?There is a spot, mid barren hills,Where winter howls, and driving rain;But if the dreary tempest chills,There is a light that warms again.The house is old, the trees are bare,Moonless above bends twilight's dome;But what on earth is half so dear,So longed for, as the hearth of home?The mute bird sitting on the stone,The dank moss dripping from the wall,The thorn-trees gaunt, the walks o'ergrown,I love them, how I love them all!Still, as I mused, the naked room,The alien firelight died away,And from the midst of cheerless gloomI passed to bright unclouded day.A little and a lone green laneThat opened on a common wide;A distant, dreamy, dim blue chainOf mountains circling every side;A heaven so clear, an earth so calm,So sweet, so soft, so hushed an air;And, deepening still the dream-like charm,Wild moor-sheep feeding everywhere.That was the scene, I knew it well;I knew the turfy pathway's sweepThat, winding o'er each billowy swell,Marked out the tracks of wandering sheep.Could I have lingered but an hour,It well had paid a week of toil;But Truth has banished Fancy's power:Restraint and heavy task recoil.Even as I stood with raptured eye,Absorbed in bliss so deep and dear,My hour of rest had fleeted by,And back came labour, bondage, care.
